0,19,Dec,2019,datasets/BattleCreek,"thank you  thank you  thank you to vice president pence  he's a good guy  we've done a great job together  and merry christmas  michigan  thank you  michigan  what a victory we had in michigan  what a victory was that  one of the greats  was that the greatest evening  but i'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas  the greatness of america and the glory of god  thank you very much  and did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again  did you notice  saying merry christmas  i remember when i first started this beautiful trip  this beautiful journey  i just said to the first lady  ""you are so lucky  i took you on this fantastic journey  it's so much fun  they want to impeach you  they want to do worse than that "" by the way  by the way  by the way  it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached  the country is doing better than ever before  we did nothing wrong  we did nothing wrong  and we have tremendous support in the republican party like we've never had before  nobody's ever had this kind of support  but this sacred season  our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never  it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now  and by the way  your state  because of us  not because of local government  but because of us  because of the job that we've done  because i understand she's not fixing those potholes  that's what the word is  it was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you  we don't want to do that  but she's not fixing the potholes  but michigan's had the best year it's ever had  best year it's ever had  and that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places  look what's happening  and you know  i don't know if you know this  but probably 10 years ago i was honored  i was the man of the year by i think somebody  whoever  i was the man of the year in michigan  can you believe it  long time  and that was long before i ever decided to do this  i was happy  i had a beautiful life  what the hell did i do this for  but look how we're doing  do we love it  i love it  but anyway  i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan  he said  ""you're still the man of the year "" thank you  who said that  thank you  so i came in and i remember the speech so well  i said  ""why are you allowing them to steal your car companies  why are you allowing them to go to mexico and to go from china where they come in from china  they build them in china  they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs  you lose your factories  the companies leave and you get nothing  why are they lying "" i asked that a long time ago and we stopped it  we've stopped it  and you see that  and we just made the usmca  we're getting rid of nafta  which i think is the worst trade deal ever  and it's very exciting  it's a great deal  it's a great deal  it's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about  it makes it very  very prohibitive  they can do it  but they've got to pay a hell of a big price to do it  and history has proven that stops them  but we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico  with canada  now  from the standpoint of the farmers  you know what's going on  we had tremendous trade barriers in canada  we had attacks on dairy products  297% tariff  nobody talked about it  with canada  and we had some really bad things with mexico  we now have a wonderful deal  and if we didn't have a good deal  you know what i would have done what  what  i would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it  right  that would have been it  unfortunately the deal's been sitting with nancy pelosi for a long time and what happened  and she had a lot of pressure  especially from manufacturing areas  farm areas  a lot of pressure to sign it  so here's what happens  so i get along with labor  i had a lot of union labor vote for me  tremendous amount of labor  in new york where i come from  we have a lot of unions  and that's okay  that's fine  so we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed  we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal  and now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay  whatever it takes  for seven months  it sits  they don't do anything  we give  and by the way  i spoke to the unions the day before i say  ""fellows  you got to get it done "" and union labor loves me and i love you too sir  i love you too sir  so we have a great deal with mexico  with canada  and it is true  i say it out loud because i say it to them right now  if they ever wanted to break the deal  that's okay  if somebody wants to break a deal with me  you always have to have an alternative  right  and this country  the deals we made  we did a deal with south korea  that's great  we did a deal with japan  40 billion dollar deal with japan  it was just a little piece of a deal  okay  that was a piece of a deal  and i said to japan  ""look  you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20% tariff on the cars  and that's more money than anything we're talking about "" that's all right  that's all right  that's all right  get her out  ger her out of here  oh well  you're about to hear the greatest speech you've ever heard  and that's going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot窶ｦ massive riots  fake news  but seriously  look  look  look  they won't say it  they won't say it  because when we have protesters all in favor  they don't talk about it  but there's a slob  there's a real slob  wait  wait a minute  she'll get hell when she gets back home with mom  but she made窶ｦ look  she screams a little bit  and you know what i like to do  avoid them  because i'll tell you the big problem  i could hardly hear her  what happens is all of you people go crazy  look  look  look  and the place  okay  so there's one disgusting person who made窶ｦ wait  wait  who made a窶ｦ i wouldn't say this  but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right  now they won't say that  the fake news  they won't say it  if one of us did that  it would be like the biggest story ever  i think it's terrible  and i'll tell you the other thing  i don't know who the security company is  but the police came up  but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out  they say  ""oh  would you please come  would you please come with me "" sure  ""ma'am  would you "" and then she gives the guy the finger and he  ""oh  oh "" you got to get a little bit stronger than that  folks  and they窶ｦ   making another group of tariffs  seven and a half percent  this gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal  which they want to start  but we're taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted  16 billion and 12 billion the previous year  helps the farmers  so you know what we do  out of that big check that we get  all that money flows into the treasury  out of the big check  we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year  and you know  the incredible thing  and i was with a lot of farmers  i was with a group of 36 farmers at the white house  you know what they said to me  i said  ""don't worry about it  we're going to take care of you guys "" and i used a bad word  you know what word i used  we're going to get you a subsidy  and they said this two years ago  i said  ""how much were you targeted for "" this was the first year  ""12 billion  sir "" the second year was 16  they were target  that's what they didn't get from china  so i said  ""it's all right  we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over "" and they said  ""sir  we don't want money  we just want a level playing field "" i've never seen that before  i've never seen that before  so we will have invested in our military  since i'm here  which is less than three years  our military  by the way  in all due respect to the previous two administrations  our military was depleted  it was depleted  it was in bad shape  we had fighter jets that were 35 years old  we had planes that were 60 years窶ｦ you heard where the father flew them  the grandfather flew them  and now the young son comes in  we've got the best equipment in the world now  spent two and a half trillion dollars  made in the usa  two and a half trillion  we will shortly  that'll be all finished  we're going to have the greatest窶ｦ now we have the best planes  we're going to have the best ships  we're building a lot of ships now  we're building the most powerful weapons in the world  now  we don't want to even talk about it  we never want to use them  but you know  the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them  we're building submarines  the power of which nobody's ever seen before  nobody's ever seen before  it's funny  we have these companies come in  i like to make good deals  you like to make good deals  that's what we do  right  so these really countries that come in  prime ministers  presidents  sometimes dictators  those we can't deal with too much  ""sir  we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine "" i say  ""no thanks "" i turn them all down  you have no idea how many people窶ｦ but we're building some of the窶ｦ they're the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind  i say mankind and womankind  they can definitely fight  they're the real deal  these guys  so good looking  i said  ""you could be a movie star  go to hollywood "" ""no sir  i like doing what i'm doing "" so i said to these guys  you going to see  just like central casting  i said  i said  ""fellas  how good is this plane "" they said  ""sir  it's great "" ""why "" ""because the enemy can't see it "" that helps  stealth  it's actually called super stealth  so i said  ""you mean they can't see  so you shoot at them but they can't窶ｦ"" he said  ""they have no idea where we are  sir "" i said  ""that sounds good to me "" nobody does it  nobody can do it  we have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes  we bought in a lot of great stuff  and i won't tell you the story  but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace  and one of the generals came up to me and said  ""sir  don't go  don't do it "" ""why "" ""we don't have the ammunition "" and i said two things  i never want to hear a president  right  we never want to have a president hear that again  nor do we want a president to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then  but  another thing we did  which to me is such an incredible thing to have done  it's such an honor  so our last us armed forces  the last branch was the air force  right  that was many  many decades ago  we are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the united states armed forces  the space force  so i'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else  ""see that space force  that was my baby "" and you think that was easy  that's not easy  because you have democrats that do not like our military  they do not like our military  and we did something yesterday  because for three years i would see people that run窶ｦ incredible people  the heads of the historically black colleges and universities in the country  and every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help  they needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job  so many great schools  but they need help  and every year they'd have to come and come  i got to know them actually  i said  ""the only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore "" because we just provided record funding for a nation's historically black colleges and universities  and it's longterm  they're not going to have to come  so i said  ""look  we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have  what do you want "" they said  ""let us just have it "" so we'll miss them  but they are great people  they've done an incredible job  and our extraordinary jobs boom  which created another 266 000 jobs last month  and then you add the undercount from the previous two months  you're close to 300 000 jobs  and they said  if you're a business watcher which i am  i love watching business  but they said they were guessing  could be 70 000  could be 80 000  maybe 90  maybe 110  somebody said  then the number comes out  266 000 with an adjustment  remember about four months ago when we had one little period  right  we had one little period where there was a little downturn  they said  ""oh  oh  we think we're going into a recession "" i said  ""don't worry about it "" ""we think we're going into a recession "" they were willing to lose their wealth  they were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own  what do you guys own back there  let it go  they'll go bust  they don't care  anything to get rid of us  not me  us  and you know what  then all of a sudden  and now for the last couple of weeks  we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets  so  as of yesterday  we've had 133 record days in the stock market now  and that's in less than three years  so when i see that i don't care because i don't窶ｦ i'm not allowed to have stock  i can't have stock  they consider it a conflict of interest and that i can understand  i agree  i can  but you know what  i'll tell you what  what i see  i see tremendous job growth because we're setting records  but you know what i also see  the 401ks where people are up 90%  they're up 97%  they're up 82%  i tell you the story all the time  i mean  i have people coming up to me  and a man came up  a policeman  i've told this story  but i've had many  so many times  but this guy in particular  because it was early and that was a year ago  that was a long time ago  right now it's much higher than that  but he said  ""sir  i want to thank you  my wife thinks i'm a loser  all my life  we never did well with the 401ks  with stocks  everything i invested  i'm up 72%  sir  she thinks i'm a financial genius  she's so in love with me  she so in love "" he said  ""she said  窶魯arling  i think you're one of the greatest investors  why don't you do this professionally ' and i don't even know what i'm doing  sir  i just have all these stocks "" so i just wanted to tell you  i look at a 401k  who has 401ks here  so that's what i see  i don't care about the rich ones  i care about everybody  i care  i care about everybody actually  ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1 5 billion dollars into auto factories in the detroit area  creating another 3000 michigan jobs  and that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from japanese companies  car companies  and other companies  but they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan  and i say  ""hey  go to michigan "" sometimes they'll go south and that's okay  whatever  i want them in this country  but ideally i want to fill them up  we're doing so well in michigan with the auto companies  now you're back  you're back  so  you're back  very proud of you  very proud of you  but while we're creating jobs  fighting for michigan workers  and achieving numbers that you've never seen before  incredible victories for the american people are happening  the radical left in congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage  you see what's going on  i'll tell you  these people are crazy  you ever hear  ""it's the economy  stupid "" you know that was clinton's saying  if you have a good economy  i have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it  nobody talks about it  if you're a democrat  they say  "" oh  it's the economy窶ｦ"" if the economy's any good  and let me just tell you a little secret  if crooked hillary would've won  your economy would have crashed  you were going down  the regulations were taking it down  the taxes were taking it down  instead of being up 92% or whatever you're up  a lot  you would have been down  you would have been at less than half  it was crashing  for all those people that would say  ""oh  it's the obama窶ｦ"" let me tell you something  you were dying  and if you look at that first period of a couple of months  it was a disaster  but it was heading south  and as sure as you're standing  and i'm sorry we couldn't get you seats  we didn't have any room  and by the way  20 000 people outside had to leave  you know  it's so cold outside we told them  ""don't worry about a screen  go home  go home and watch "" but we had  this is about a 5 500 seat arena  and i said to my people  ""why so small "" are we spoiled  i watch these guys come in like biden  he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up  no  it's true  i don't understand it  and did you see the new polls from usa today came out  i'm killing everybody  and they hate me  usa today hates me  but there's a poll  we're beating everybody  but  so biden has this rally  they've got 200 seats  but only a small number of people  so you know what they do  they set up a round table  so think of these people  they come in  they think they're going to listen to the speech  they end up sitting on a round table discussing窶ｦ they must've been happy  right  we don't have enough room for round tables  i'm sorry folks  no  they set up a round table but i think we're doing great  and how do you beat what we've done  with the economy  with our great vets  with choice  you've finally got choice  they've been trying to get it for almost 50 years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  and these people back here  your seat or stand is better  right  but you know what  they're going to be much more famous because the cameras can't see you  they can only see them  and the other thing  the cameras  do you ever notice  i go to these stadiums  25  30 000 people  they never show the crowd  you know why  because they don't want to have窶ｦ if crazy pocahontas  if crazy pocahontas goes to the middle of central park or whatever  she's in manhattan  you got me  and people  i mean  i could have  i could have baron trump go into central park and he'd get a crowd that would be just as窶ｦ he's 13  he'd get a bigger crowd  but if she has the crowd  ""oh  these crowds are so big "" i've had crowds over the last couple of weeks  we went to different pennsylvania  florida  but i mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these nba arenas  right  big arenas  and we set records at everyone because we use the floor  thank you  i appreciate it  but we use the floor  right  the basketball court  so we set records at every arena  they never even mention the crowds  they never mention the crowds  it's sort of amazing  you know what  i don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time i came down the escalator  that's a long time ago  i don't think we've ever had an empty seat  now what the crooked media does though  if you got like over here  look how packed it is and there's thousands outside  but i窶ｦ ""please go home  you're going to catch pneumonia "" but here's the thing  if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom  those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say ""trump wasn't able to fill up the arena "" i always get nervous when i see some窶ｦ i know they're coming back  nobody ever leaves our speeches  because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally  but every time i see a man get up  i see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up  the baby's going crazy and they're getting up  they're going to take it窶ｦ but i know they're going to be right back  and i say  ""fill those two seats  i don't want them to see it "" because they'll say  ""couldn't fill up the arena "" these are truly dishonest people  after three years of sinister witch hunts  hoaxes  scams  tonight the house democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic americans  capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history  was that the greatest  remember when they all said  remember when they all said  ""no  no  you can't win michigan  you can't "" then i went  i did one in grand rapids  right  grand rapids  we had 32 000 people that night  it was one o'clock in the morning  that means it was election day when i started speaking  hillary  barack obama  michelle obama  and bill clinton  they did an emergency trip  they did an emergency trip to michigan at six o'clock  they got here at prime time  they started to speak  she had 500 people  i got here at one o'clock in the morning the next day  which is now election day  how many people were there  32 000 people outside  inside  it was the last speech of michigan  and they say  ""well  sir  it's very hard to win michigan "" i said  ""why would it be hard "" here's the beautiful thing  everything i told you i've done  but much more so  i said i was going to bring car companies back  i said i was going to bring in窶ｦ i just hope you people know that  i just hope you know it  but i'll never forget that night  and in all fairness to bill clinton  he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office  i like him  i like him  but he told  you know the way they tried to shut him out  right  because he's a pro  he's an instinct guy  right  he's instinct  he doesn't need窶ｦ right  because he's a pro  he's an instinct guy  right  he's instinct  he doesn't need polling companies  who the hell wants him  you know  if you want a polling company  pick up the newspaper  the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write  they write fake polls  it's true  they write fake polls  you call them suppression polls  you read them and you get depressed  because it looks like you're doing badly  they do that  i think it's almost worse than what they write  and you can't get much worse than what they write  so what happens is bill clinton said to crooked hillary  his very dishonest wife  crooked hillary  do you think he calls her crooked hillary  he might  maybe he just calls her crooked  he said  ""crooked  i'm telling you  crooked  i don't like what i'm seeing in michigan  i don't like what i'm seeing in wisconsin "" he said  ""i took the trip to wisconsin and i'll tell you what  they had those trump/pence signs all the way to the convention area  every lawn  every loan  i don't like wisconsin "" and then he said  ""oh  don't worry about it "" what the hell does he know  they told him  ""what do you know "" remember  they shut him out at the 窶ｦ they didn't want him talking  he was right  i mean  i don't want to cause any problems in the family  but he was right  but he talked about wisconsin  then he talked about michigan  he said  ""crooked  i'm telling you  crooked  i don't like what i'm seeing in michigan  i was in michigan and i'm telling you  they had those damn signs  i saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn  and two of them on the car "" and he said  ""you horrible human being  you'd better start listening to me  because you're going to get your ass whooped  and you know what happened  you know what happened  she didn't listen  fortunately  and she didn't come to michigan enough  and she didn't come to wisconsin  i think at all  right  because her polling data looked good  it looked good to me  too  every time i went there with these crowds  so we won wisconsin  we won michigan and the great ronna mcdaniel 窶ｦ where is ronna  where is ronna  ronna  she was so horrible  i didn't know her  ronna mcdaniel  and she was so aggressive  she kept calling and said  ""could you please come out to michigan "" i said  ""who the hell are you "" and i said  ""what do you mean  another trip "" so anyway  i made  we had these big crowds  i made it again  then finally i said  two weeks out  i said  ""ronna  no more  we're going to win it or we're not "" ""okay "" 00 in the evening for this final deal in grand rapids  ""sir  could you come to michigan tonight "" and i thought  i was just about finished  i went to a last great state  and i said  ""it's over "" now i sit back and i watch  and let's see what happens  right  but she said  ""could you come to michigan "" i said  that is the most aggressive human being i've ever met  and we did it  and we won michigan  and the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan  you better remember when you walk into 窶ｦ you know  it's november 3rd this time  november 3rd  by the way though  that evening  that incredible evening in november  one of the biggest nights in the history of television  you never hear them say it  so i might as well  that election 窶ｦ and my debates 窶ｦ you see their debates are dying  who wants to watch buttigieg  buttigieg  buttigieg  you know that you pronounce it they say 窶ｦ i heard some guy saying  ""no  no  because it's an unpronounceable name "" that's why they call him mayor pete  right  mayor pete  mayor pete  mayor pete  i've had you up to here  mayor pete  no  buttigieg is leading  how does 窶ｦ no  you say it this way  you say it 窶ｦ they call him mayor pete  because nobody can pronounce his last name  that's the only 窶ｦ people think it says 窶ｦ by the way  you know what  i'm not going to say bad things about him  you know why  i'd love him to win  i thought i knocked off pocahontas  i did it a year too early  a year too early  i give her credit  she then started to come back  i don't think she's going to make it though  she's gasping  she's gasping for air  but i saw them pronouncing buttigieg  and they said  ""here's what you do  boot edge edge "" say  ""edge  like the edge of a building  edge edge "" buttigieg  alfred e  newman  you got to be older to know what that means  but congressional democrats are directly attacking 2 3 million michigan voters who rose up in 2016  won the state  and now the democrats are very upset  they want to get michigan back  they just don't know how to do it  because they didn't do a thing for michigan  they didn't do anything for michigan  all they did was take away your companies and let them go to mexico and other places  you know  i don't know if you know it  mexico has 32% of your car business  you know that  right  not because of me  they're not moving  but mexico has 窶ｦ 32% of our car business moved to mexico  can you believe this  before i got there  but that's what i used to talk about  i said  when i was honored that night  i said  ""how do you let this happen  how do you let all these companies leave "" it used to go  窶ｦ it's probably maybe the single biggest reason i ran for president  it might be the 窶ｦ and i had a lot of them  immigration  i had a lot of them  but that may be the single biggest  with today's illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment  the do nothing democrats  and they are do nothing 窶ｦ all they want to do is focus on this  what they could be doing 窶ｦ are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the american voter  this lawless  partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the democrat party  have you seen my polls in the last four weeks  it's crazy  it's crazy  you know why  because people  we have an election right down the road  i announced three months ago that i'm running  right  i'll give you a little clue  i announced because i figured once i announce  they'd never impeach  nobody would be so stupid  but they'd been trying to impeach me from day one  they've been trying to impeach me from before i ran  okay  because if you remember when i ran  i went immediately to number one  never came off number one  we had center stage from day one in the debates  so we had  i don't know  14  15 debates  we had a total of 18  actually  people forgot there was one that they never talk about it  but that's okay  but we had 18 people  and i was center stage  and i said  ""wait a minute  this is no good "" i want odd numbers  because of your center stage  if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle  so i said  ""make it 11 or make it nine  or i'm not showing up "" and generally they did it  because we were way ahead from the beginning  but i made a lot of great friends out of that group  and many of them are good friends today  although you wouldn't know it based on the 窶ｦ they say that was the meanest 窶ｦ that was a pretty mean primary  you got to say  wasn't that fun  i liked it  through their depraved actions today  crazy nancy pelosi's house democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame  and it really is  it's a disgrace  democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president  they think that the washington swamp  which we believe it or not  it ain't easy  because they got so much stacked  including these guys  you know what  these guys are apart of the democrat party  they are a part of it  you might as well call them democrats  you know  it's owned by commicast  they're just as bad as cnn  or they're just as bad as msnbc  and by the way  cnn and msnbc  their ratings are down the tubes  it's great  i love it  i love it  but they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election  that's what they think  there's never been a time like this  think of it  you have the greatest economy in the history of the world  other countries come to see me  all of their leaders  and they say  ""sir  "" first thing  ""sir  congratulations on your economy  we're trying to do the same thing  congratulations  sir "" and these guys don't like talking about it  and if they do  they say  ""obama did it  oh  obama  obama "" remember obama said  ""you will never be president  he will never be president "" then remember he said  ""i will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president "" and then i became president  he wasn't so happy  and in all fairness  he campaigned harder than crooked hillary  because he had more strength  i mean  i go to these places  secret service  they take me  i haven't seen a lobby in three years  it's true  i go through basements  i pass compactor plants  i know more about compactors from this job  i don't see lobbies  i say ""fellows  you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby "" ""no  sir "" but i'll tell you what  i go upstairs  downstairs  all around  they're taking me up three flights  go down one  i said  ""are we almost there "" ""yes  sir  another four flights "" and i say  ""you think hillary could do this  i don't think so "" they'd bring her back home  she wants to go to sleep  and now i hear she wants to run again  wouldn't that be great  oh  thank you  thank you  oh would we love that  you think the democrats are screwed up  wait until that happens  wouldn't that be 窶ｦ oh  there's my guy  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  well look  based on the fbi report  you just saw what happened with the ig  where they came out with the fbi  based on that  you know what  i never stopped you  but now  think of what they did  think of what they did  think of how dishonest it all was  they shouldn't even be allowed to have an impeachment  because it was based on dishonesty  it was based on illegality  she went out  and they paid for a fake dossier  they gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier  totally disproven  totally fake  the fbi then took that fake dossier and they used it in the fisa court to get approval to spy on my campaign  and if we were democrats  they would've been in jail two years ago  it's a disgrace  think of what they did  so they use this fake dossier  and they brought it before this big deal court  it's a big deal  the fisa court  and they said this stuff  and they lied about it  because comey  who's another beauty 窶ｦ did i do a great job when i fired his ass  what a great job  oh no  they had bad plans  no  i did a great thing  that was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest  did that place explode  and then we learned about lisa page  and her wonderful lover  peter strzok  i love you lisa  i love you more than anybody in the world  i love you more than anybody in the world  it causes problems with the wife  but we won't talk about that  those tapes didn't work well  no  how about those statements  right  and then they say  ""in all fairness "" 窶ｦ i really liked the report  but how does the inspector general say 窶ｦ because don't forget  he was appointed by obama  so i'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets  but we had a lot of those nuggets  how does the inspector general say  ""you have these horrible 窶ｦ he's going to lose  isn't he  he's going to lose  or she's going to win 100 million "" did you see all the zeros  it was like 窶ｦ i'm blinking  i says  ""i think it's 100 "" ""he's going to lose 100 to one  isn't he peter  i love you so much  peter  i've never loved anyone like you  he's going to lose 100 million to one  peter  right "" ""that's right  he's going to lose 100 million to one "" but there's no bias  how about the insurance policy  to me  the greatest  just in case she loses  we have an insurance policy  we're in the insurance policy right now folks  we've been in it for three years  that's what they meant  i mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator  because we're doing awfully well  and i'll tell you something  rush limbaugh said it  sean hannity said it  laura ingram said it  tucker said it  ainsley said it  but a lot of people have said it  they said  ""there's nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened  and still created one of the greatest economies  and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years "" i understand that  i understand that  but it's my life  very unfair to my family  i have to say this very  very unfair to my family  what they put my family through is a disgrace  me  it's my life  it's fine  i do  but you know what  what they put my family through is a disgrace  and they ought to be ashamed  and we should get apologies all over the place  so yesterday i sent pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party's outrageous abusive power  that's what it is  they have nothing  they're the ones that should be impeached  every one of them  i mean you got this guy  schiff  he makes up a statement  and he goes in front of congress where he has immunity  and he makes up a statement from me that's totally fictitious  totally out of thin air  the worst statement i've ever heard  many people saw it  i had a person two weeks ago that said  ""i didn't love the statement you made  i said  ""really  didn't you read the transcripts "" i always say  ""read the transcript  but didn't you read it"" ""no  no  i heard it on television  i watched adam schiff "" he made it up  i then sent him the transcript  he said  ""oh  now i feel better  that's perfect "" i call it perfect  he called it perfect  everyone calls it  if you read it  but here's the thing  he makes up this statement  and it finished  didn't he have eight quid pro quos  eight  could you imagine  you're dealing with a country  and you say eight times that you've got to do something  the first time they say  ""well "" the second time they say  ""that's strange "" third time they say  ""what's wrong "" you said eight times  eight times  they'd have you arrested  they'd have you put into an insane asylum  but he actually said 窶ｦ i think he said eight  not seven  eight  and then he finished with  ""don't call me  i'll call you "" can you imagine  the president of the united states  ""don't call me  i'll call you "" you know what that is  that's a mafia statement  okay  that's the head of the mafia saying  ""don't call me "" this guy actually said that  and then he walked away and people became incensed  because they knew that wasn't the people that read the thing  most people believed him  he's a liar  because you know  he's a corrupt politician  100%  no  he's a corrupt 窶ｦ and then i see him  by the way  you ever see this guy  he walks up to the mics  i mean  we're not 窶ｦ all fairness  look  i don't want to be 窶ｦ because with me too  i never even think about looks anymore  okay  i don't talk about looks of a male or a female  but in his case  let's just say 窶ｦ the last time i'll ever refer to this  he's not exactly the best looking guy we've ever seen  no  any mic  he walks up to the mic  and he's so just  ""this is a sad  sad day for america  our president is an employee of russia  i have absolute proof that the president "" this is at the beginning  and every week they'd say  ""where's the proof "" ""it's coming  it's coming "" then we get the mueller report  nothing  and i'll tell you what  i know some of the people in this audience  if i spent not  45 million  not 18 trump haters  i call them the angry democrats  it was 13  then it went to 18  and then mueller  did muller do a good job  did he do a good job  no  boo  how was his performance in front of congress  boo  not the best  but think of this   45 million they spent  and you know  i heard somebody say  ""well  we got back some of that money "" let me tell you  you cost this country billions  and billions  and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn't get done  in all of the embarrassment to our country  you caused billions and billions of dollars  and it was a hoax  but this guy  schiff  ""i have absolute proof  i have this  i have that  this  that "" anytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced  stone faced  he's a pathological liar  he gets up  and i've never seen anything like it  even i was saying  ""i wonder what he has  what does he have "" he says  ""i have absolute "" i said  ""i haven't spoken to russia in year  what the hell do i have to do with russia "" but this guy gets up 窶ｦ oh  i think we have a vote coming in  haleigh  wow  thank you  haleigh  great job  wow  the republican party has never been so affronted  but they've never been so united as they are right now  ever  never  and i know the senators  and they're great guys  and women too  we have some great women  we have great guys  they're great people  they love this country  they're going to do the right thing  they're going to do the right thing  so i said in my letter to pelosi 窶ｦ i love that  you know  usually there's one  two  the republicans  look  i've said it for a long time  the democrats are lousy politicians  they really are  they've got horrible policies  open borders  crime is fine  drugs pouring through  i mean  think of what they do  sanctuary cities  they love sanctuary cities  they're lousy politicians  but they have one thing 窶ｦ two things  they are vicious  they're the most vicious people  the republicans aren't as vicious  they may learn to be vicious after going through this  though  but the other thing  the democrats always stick together  now think of it  three democrats went over to our side  no republicans  it's unheard of  and by the way  this is for a hundred years  i'm not just talking about this little point in time  the republicans are known as  it's always harder to stick together  these people are great  we have a great republican party  and we have to get that change  we have to take back the house  you'll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take 窶ｦ and by the way  we had another victory  the individual mandate  just a little while ago  it came over the wires  it was just upheld  the individual mandate is now gone  the most unpopular part of obamacare  it was just upheld  so i said in my letter to pelosi  ""by proceeding with your invalid impeachment  you're violating your oath of office  you're breaking your allegiance to the constitution  you're declaring open war on american democracy  you dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme  yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for america's founding  and your egregious conduct "" and listen though  it's so true  it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged  and in fact their very lives to build  ""you are the ones interfering in america's elections  you are the one subverting america's democracy  we did nothing wrong  nothing

violated the constitution "" you had turley  who's smart  alan dershowitz  these guys  all of them  they said  ""there's no crime  there's no crime "" right  there's no crime  there's no crime  i'm the first person that ever get impeached  and there's no crime  i feel guilty  you know what they call it  impeachment light  it's impeachment light  that's why  with richard nixon  i just see it as a very dark era  very dark  very 窶ｦ oh  you don't even like to think  i don't know about you  but i'm having a good time  it's crazy  but i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party  we really do  maybe i wouldn't feel the same way  but we have a great group of people behind us  we had in the house  and we have it in the senate  they're doing a great job  so i'm not worried  i'm not worried  because it's always good when you don't do anything wrong  you get impeached  that may be a record that will last forever  but you know what they have done  they've cheapened the impeachment process  and now anybody that become 窶ｦ this is a sacred position  anybody that becomes president  i mean  they could have a phone call and they get impeached  so if the

our founding fathers didn't want  and they said it could happen  and it's happened  but i know one thing  americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office  but it's so disappointing  i see a woman  carolyn maloney  she's a long time  nothing much  believe me  she's a congresswoman from manhattan  the east side  i was with her  her first race  i helped her  she was always so nice  ""oh  thank you  thank you "" i made lots of contributions over the years  in new york  if you're not a 窶ｦ it's purely democrat  especially in manhattan  so what happens  i make lots of contributions for years  and years  and years  i go run  the first person i see  carolyn maloney  i raise my hand to impeach  well  give me back the damn money that i've been paying her for so many years  let her pay me back all the money  let her pay me back all the money  then you have this dingell  dingell  you know dingell  from michigan  you know dingell  you ever hear of her  michigan  debbie dingell  that's a real beauty  so she calls me up like eight months ago  her husband was here a long time  but i didn't give him the b treatment  i didn't give him the c or the d  i could've  nobody what is  you know  i gave the a+ treatment  ""take down the flags "" ""while you're taking them down for ex-congressman dingell 窶ｦ"" ""oh  okay "" "" 窶ｦ do this  do that  do that  rotunda everything "" i gave him everything  that's okay  i don't want anything for it  i don't need anything for anything  she calls me up  ""it's the nicest thing that's ever happened  thank you so much  john would be so thrilled  he's looking down  he'd be so thrilled  thank you so much  sir "" i said  ""that's okay  don't worry about it "" maybe he's looking up  i don't know  i don't know  maybe  maybe  but let's assume he's looking down  but i gave him a+  not a  not b+  not b  i gave him the a+  and she called me  she said  ""oh  no "" i won't go into the conversation  because it's not fair do that  but all i want to say is  let's put it this way  it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10  it was a 10  okay  so that was what  february or something  now they talk about this phony impeachment  and she's out there  ""well  we have to look seriously at our president  because he may have violated the constitution of the united states "" boo  ""and i can't be happy with that  because i love our country  i love this  and i love that "" she loves everything  i said  ""she's a no "" okay  no  but i look at her  and she's so sincere  and what happens  ""i vote to impeach trump "" and you know what  i didn't say  ""who the hell knew this was even going to come up "" i went through the whole muller hoax  they did this big report  i was totally exonerated  they didn't even bring it up at the impeachment  because i was totally exonerated  if they saw one little kernel  one little quarter of a sentence 窶ｦ look what they did with one word  remember this  what did i do  why did i do  it's us  but they don't say it that way  they say  ""i "" they read it totally different  schiff and his band of thieves  they read it  now i say basically  very simple  do us a favor  our country  do us  do us  not me  our country  and then what do i say  i say  ""the united states attorney general  attorney general of the united states could speak to you  it would be great "" okay  because it's known for major corruption  in fact  the new leader of ukraine got in on a construction 窶ｦ on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty  and everything that was going on in ukraine  right  he looked for it  that's how he got into office  he got into office that way  so we take it and they repeat it a thousand times  and they never say with the right 窶ｦ so i go wild  and we start  and the republicans have got it right  now we always correct him  but i use the word us  us is the united states  our country  and then it actually says  i think  ""comma  country "" but they don't say that  they say  ""do me a favor "" how many times have you heard it  where they say in a speech  ""and then the president said  do me a favor "" well  that's not what i said  i said  ""do us a favor  our country "" and then i said  the attorney general of the united states  i didn't say my campaign- i said the attorney general of the united states  i didn't say my campaign manager  okay  i said the attorney 窶ｦ and these people want to impeach the president of the united states for that  oh  and then what happened  right  then what happened  so then  the president of ukraine  who's a quality person  said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  that was a killer for the democrats  right  then his foreign minister said the same thing  he said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever  there was no pressure  that's a killer  so now did you see what the democrats did a couple of days ago  they tried to say that he's not a strong person  that he was weak  they used the word weak  that he was weak  and under the power of trump  he said  do you know how insulting that is  anybody that becomes president of a country  and that's a big country and it's a tough country  you got to be tough  he's tough  but so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording  it just doesn't fit  okay  these are really dishonest people  and if the press was fair  this thing never would have happened  so the house democrats are surrendering their majority  their dignity  their reputations  they look like a bunch of fools  and i'll tell you  we have a lot of new stars in the republican party  i could read off a list of 20 names  but they're giving up their honor  and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office  when you take a look  that ballot box  that ballot box on november 3rd  i think we're going to have crowds like we've never had  and i'll tell you something  it used to be  they'd always say  ""oh  the republicans "" you know  in 2018  i didn't run  i didn't run  right  they all said  ""oh  we didn't "" well actually  we picked up two seats in the senate that these guys never talk about  we just approved 171 federal court justices  171 federal justices  including courts of appeal  171  we'll be up  probably by the end of the year  to 182  and for that  i thank president obama  he gave me 142 openings  he gave me 142  i said to him  my people  i got there  because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and supreme court  we have two great supreme court judges  right  two justices of the supreme court  kavanaugh  gorsuch  two great men  they're great  and how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through  right  over a phony deal  i hate to tell you  over a phony deal  what a disgrace  what they put that man through and that family through  just remember it come november  you got to remember  it's a long time  you know  in the life of trump  10 months is an eternity  it's a long time  somebody said  ""congratulations sir  you're going to win "" i said  ""don't say that  just don't talk about it  let's always pretend you're one point down "" like last time  going to be close  nope  it's going to be close  but what they put that man through was horrible  what they put his family through was horrible  and you know  those stories largely have been recanted  and frankly  the ones that didn't recant  i don't know what a supreme court judge does  but he should sue them  he should sue them  so we want to take back the house  we'll hold the senate  and we'll keep the white house  you will have the greatest healthcare  you will continue with the greatest judges  you know  we have judges that are 窶ｦ we just had a great story in the wall street journal  i have to be always very truthful  because if i'm a little bit off  they call me a liar  they'll say  ""he gets a pinocchio "" the stupid washington post  they have pinocchio  i mean  even if you're saying things perfectly  it's a pinocchio  there's nothing you can say where you don't get a pinocchio  but what happens  what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story  they said  ""whether you like him or not  the job he's done on judges and supreme court justices  but the job he's done on judges is amazing  say it's the most important thing  see  i don't agree  i say defense is the most  the military is the most  but once you're beyond the military  i mean to me defense is the most important  because without good defense  maybe we don't need judges so much  right  it's like somebody said  ""well  we violated the budget "" i said  ""do me a favor  don't worry about the budget  if we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says  窶聾ell  at least we have a good budget ' that doesn't work too well "" right  that doesn't work  so we have great military  we have great judges  we have great everything  drug prices down  for the first time in 51 years  drug prices came down  and that was with no help from the democrats  if they helped  because you need their votes  if they helped  i could get those drug prices down 40 and 50%  okay  and we just approved  and we're approving very soon for the governor of florida  ron desantis  where he can buy  he has the right to go  we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country  where the prices for the identical drug  identical drug are 50% less  he's going to do that for the people of florida  and we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that  we'll get that down so far  everyone in america can see straight through the washington democrats' phony  dangerous charade  schiff makes up so many things  pelosi makes it up  and she backs him up  i saw her on a television show  and george stephanopoulos  that's another beauty  he said  even he said  he was defending me  i couldn't believe it  he made this statement  ""but you know he lied on that  he made up this stuff "" ""no  he didn't  he didn't "" so that means nancy pelosi said no  the statement that he made up  but it's all going to end soon  and it's going to come out to a beautiful  great victory for the republican party and for this nation  thank you very much  so that's it  we have the greatest country  we've turned around a ship  we need four more years  if we don't have it 窶ｦ now  if you want to drive them crazy  we had one group in pennsylvania  some guy started screaming  "" 16 more years "" 16  they went crazy  and you know what they don't understand  when i do get out  they're all going to go out of business  they're making more money than they've ever made  that crazy new york times  one of the worst newspapers in the world  one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world  totally phony  they came out with a story  where it was a great headline for me  and the people that read it  the super radical left  they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story  can you believe it  no  they're among the most dishonest people  but i'll never forget  before i took that great escalator ride down with our first lady 窶ｦ our first lady is doing a great job  great job  i said  ""first lady  you're so lucky i took you on this journey  this wonderful  beautiful journey "" and it is  you know why it's a wonderful  beautiful journey  because look at  what we're accomplishing is unbelievable  it's unprecedented  it is unprecedented what we're accomplishing  ""you're so lucky "" i said it to all my people  i have great people in the back  i say  ""you folks are so lucky i took you on this  you could be home right now  relaxing "" but i'd rather be here  frankly  than any place  these rallies are great  they're inspiring  you are inspiring  and you know  it's funny  we're not even into election season  yeah  it's a long way away  we're not even in it  and yet  i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election  does that make any sense  i think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt  a lot of it has to do with the phony  witch hunt because you're smart people  you're the elite  they're not the elite  you're the elite  you're the elite  you do better than they do  they talk about it  don't you hate it  ""well  the elite 窶ｦ "" oh really  i went to better schools  many of you went to better schools  we won't talk about homes  even though your homes are nicer  we won't talk about jobs  you see the jobs reports  you see what's happening  do you see where wages are going up  you know  when i first started  when i was here  one of my first speeches  i was talking that people made more money  that was four years ago  so it was 20 years before that  so that's 24  25 years ago  they made more money 24 years ago than they were making when i got elected president  and they worked one job versus two or three jobs  now it's going up beautifully and we want that  the salaries  and you know  the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker  it's percentage  the best  the blue collar worker  they had two and three jobs  the blue collar worker is going up the most  anyway  so you know what else  the thing i'm happiest about  african american unemployment  the lowest in the history of our country  african american  remember i used to say  you remember  look at  you  are you the greatest guy  everyone thinks  do i pay  i'm telling you  i have a group of african american guys  and gals by the way  that follow me around and they think i pay them  and i don't  i love them  they love me  they come  how many rallies have you come to  a lot  they're great people  just great  thank you  i don't even know who the hell he is  is that right  i don't know him  but i like him  i see him at so many rallies  i appreciate it  you and your group  they're great people  thank you  so you're obviously doing well if you can travel around like that  right  ah  he knows  i appreciate it  i really do  i think it's fantastic  thank you  thank you  but think of this  african-american unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country  their poverty levels  they had a horrible poverty level  in the negative sense  now their poverty levels are the best they've ever been in the history of our country  same with hispanic americans  the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers  and the same with asians  the best unemployment  and women  i'm sorry  71 years  best in 71 years  i've let the women down  but i think within another couple of months  you'll be historical  so only 71 years best  the best in 71 years  but what we're doing has been an incredible thing  it's an incredible thing  when i'm on the debate stage with one of these characters  and they try and say negative stuff  i'll just say  ""well  here's the story  in the history of our country  this group is doing the best  and that group is doing the best  and the women are doing the best  and everybody's doing  and frankly  you know what it is  the whole country's doing the best  okay  the whole country is doing the best "" so we have records and everything  and yet they're trying to  and they really are  i've never seen anything like it

about that question  i won't say who answered  because you know i'm not  i actually used to like the guy  he was a nice guy to me  but now i don't like him so much  but that's okay  but he goes

on tape  and they always say it's unsubstantiated  ""it is not supported by fact "" one of them the other day  they finally changed the word  ""it is supported by fact "" no  it's supported by tape

know what they're going to say  every stadium is packed  i give my people one instruction  get the largest stadium you can get  now  that's why i was a little surprised  but in battle creek  you don't have that many  right  not too many stadiums  but i wanted to be here  you know why i wanted to be here  first of all the crowd is incredible  the crowd outside  but let me tell you  no  you know why i wanted to be here  because we have a lot of choices  but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly  and i said  ""i want to be there "" pretty simple  pretty simple  pretty simple  i wanted to be here for that reason  and i just want to say thank you  because i'll tell you what  you came in 窶ｦ i don't know  i didn't get 100%  but we got a damn good percentage  right  we got a damn good percentage  so it's really thrilling to be here  but we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders  your michigan house speaker  lee chatfield  where's lee  lee  come up if you want  come on  what the hell  we have nothing else to do  should we get him up  yes  come up lee  come up lee  get up here  come on up  lee  republican party chairwoman  ronna mcdaniel  who i spoke to  and the bottom line on the end of her story  so when i won i said  ""who's going to head up the rnc "" i said  ""i got to get that woman from michigan "" remember they were all saying  ""you can't win michigan""  now we're going to win it by so much  you better remember all those  every time a car plant opens  please think about trump  come on up here  lee  michigan gop chairwoman  laura cox  thank you  hate to tell you  but all your congressmen  you know where they are right now  your congressmen  all of your congresspeople  men  wonderful people  they're at a place called congress right now  they're doing an unbelievable job of supporting your president and supporting you  they had a choice  ""sir  should we leave and be there "" i said  ""don't leave  stay right where you are "" that's why we got that vote  that's some vote  right lee  the chairman of the woman's workers and workers for trump  and a proud union autoworker  terry bowman  who's been so terrific  thank you  terry  come on up  and while democrats are obsessed with impeachment  we're focused on jobs  jobs  jobs  this group  local leaders  and all your washington folks  they are right where they have to be in washington tonight  thank you  thank you  great job  thank you very much  we've eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country  whether it's four years or eight years  or in one case  much more than eight years  in a period of two and a half years  we have eliminated more regulations than any other president  by far  you're saving almost  3 000 a year because of regulation cuts  total income gains for median households will reach  10 000 a family  i'll give you a couple of quick numbers  so under president bush  for eight years  you saved  450  meaning you took in 450 bucks  okay  fine  under president obama  you took in  975  under president trump  including the energy savings  and the regulation savings  and the tax cut savings  it's more than  10 000 in less than three years  pretty good  right  so for two eight-years  you had a 400  450  and a 975  that's eight years  450  in less than three years  you had more than  10 000  that goes right into your pockets  it's one of the reasons our economy is doing well  because  as they say  the consumer is doing better than they've ever done  and that's great  that's what we wanted  we've ended the war on american energy  and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth  and these maniacs want to close it up  how about going to texas  you know beto  what  remember what he said  i said  ""oh  this guy's a loser  you know a salesman  like if you're a great salesman  you never talk that you're a great salesman  you don't walk in and say  ""well  i'm a great salesman  i can sell 窶ｦ "" any guy that does that  they're no good  it's those quiet type that get you  you know  the ones that don't talk  so beto  when he first got in  remember this clown  he gets in  no  no  he gets in  ""i was made for this job  to run for president "" after about two weeks  they killed him  he was gone  but you remember  he was against the bible  he was against religion  he was against guns  and he was against oil and gas  and he comes from texas  i said  that's a platform  think of it  he's against religion  he's against guns  and against oil and gas  think of it  i don't like to bring it up because he's gone zone  but he comes from texas  i said  ""abraham lincoln can't win in texas with that platform "" but they are  all of them  they want to close up your energy  it's a big deal  they want to close up your steel mills  they don't want your steel mills  look at what i've done for steel  i mean  the steel is back  we taxed all of the dump steel coming in from china and other places  and your steel mills that are doing great  they're expanding all over the country  and they were going to be out of business within two years  the way they were going  they were gone  united states steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions  every major democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the u s  auto industry forever  and you know why  because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric  i want to have an alternative  a big alternative  you're going to always have the alternative  and a lot of people don't know of the electric can ever catch the gas  you know  and by the way  there'll be different forms of energy coming along  but they want to close them up  and we're not closing them up  we're going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing  you can have it for a lot of different reasons  we're even bringing back the old light bulb  you heard about that  right  the old light bulb  which is better  i say  ""why do i always look so orange "" you know why  because of the new light  they're terrible  you look terrible  they cost you many  many times more  like four or five times more  and you know they're considered hazardous waste  when a light bulb is out  you've got to bring it to a dump  so let's say  over here in battle creek  where's your nearest dump  okay  that's what  a couple of hundred miles away  so every time you lose 窶ｦ drive a couple of hundred miles  right  i said  ""how many people do that "" nobody  what do they do  they throw it in the garbage  but you know what it is  because it's all gas  it's much more expensive  four or five times more  and i came into office  i did a lot of this  sinks  showers  all of this stuff  i did a lot of it  no water comes out  you have areas where there's so much water  you don't know what to do with it  you turn on the shower  you're not allowed to have any water anymore  i mean  we do a lot of it  dishwashers  we did the dishwasher  right  you press it  remember the dishwasher  you'd press it  boom  there'd be like an explosion  five minutes later you open it up  the steam pours out  the dishes  now you press it 12 times  the women tell me  ""again "" you know  they give you four drops of water  and they're in places where there's so much water  they don't know what to do with it  so we just came out with a reg on dishwashers  we're going back to the old  by the way  by the time they press it 10 times  you spend more on water  and electric  don't forget  the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric  so we're bringing back standards that are great  and better machinery that you can have the water again  right  but with the light bulb  i said  ""what's going on with the light bulbs  a lot of people are complaining about the cost "" so i had a couple of experts come in  i said  ""tell me  what gives a better light "" ""well  we liked the old light bulb better "" i said  ""i like it better "" and so what i did is you can have either one  if you want to buy the newer kind  you can  and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind  like i do  so we're bringing back the old light bulb  so it's a much less expensive  it probably gives a better light  but whatever it is  and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb  i mean  it sounds like little  but it's big stuff  okay  it's big stuff  and we're doing it with a lot of other things  our dishwashers  and you know  i won't tell you one of the things  because every time i tell you  they do a big number on it  you know the one i'm talking about  right  sinks  right  showers  and what goes with a sink and a shower  10 times  right  10 times  not me  of course  not me  but you  him  but i never mention that  because one time i mentioned all three  i said  ""sinks  showers  and toilets "" the headline was  ""trump with the toilets  toilets "" that's all they want  they don't even mention it  so i didn't mention that  okay  i go off the record  but you know what  it's terrible  you want to wash your hands  you turn on the sink  no water comes out  so you leave the water going 10 times as long  it's the same thing  you have a shower  drip  it's no good for me  for me  you know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business  they always used to say i wore a hairpiece  it's okay  i know people wear hairpieces  but they always used to say  they don't say that anymore because i have been through the worst storms  if you wear one of those suckers  you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you  you look handsome  don't worry about it  but in the last two decades before my election  we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country  the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they've wanted to do for so many years  and that's why it doesn't work  we look so forward to taking it on  and it is all about cleaning the swamp  draining the swamp  and we have a very  very big  bad  dangerous swamp  okay  that's enough of that  that's enough  so among the very first acts that i did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the u s  auto industry  i withdrew from the horrible trans pacific partnership  that would have ended your auto industry  a lot of people don't know that  but i do  remember tpp  we were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off  the people that made these trade deals  it's like  where do they come  like the one in korea  that was a hillary clinton special  she said  ""this will produce 250 000 new jobs "" and i said  ""well  what happened "" he said  ""well  she was right "" except it was for south korea  not for us  no  it's true  it produced 250 000 jobs for south korea  these deals were so bad  but now they're getting really good  and some of them are getting great  and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal  wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time  but we have to go through a little pain  because we have to do it  and then they all say  ""we're going to withdraw "" and then i say  ""you can withdraw  i don't care  we're putting tariffs on your country "" then they say  ""we'd love to make a deal  sir "" the new usmca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong  since the election  we've created 41 000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs  manufacturing jobs  remember the statement by president obama  ""you'd have to wave a magic wand "" remember the magic wand  because manufacturing 窶ｦ and i said  ""you know  that sounds strange  what do you do if you don't have manufacturing  how do you make things "" right  manufacturing jobs won't happen  well  we've got 600 000 manufacturing jobs  and you're going to see a big  big increase  the truth is  we need more people  you know what  we need more people  we need more people coming into the country  and they're going to come in  and they're going to come in through merit  and they're going to love our country  and they're going to respect our country  and they're going to work  we do need more people  they're opening these massive  foxconn in wisconsin  they're opening these massive plants and it's hard to get people  we want people coming in  but they have to come in  only they have to come in through merit  fiat-chrysler recently announced a  4 5 billion investment in michigan  including the first new auto plant in detroit in more than a generation  and general motors recently announced a  300 million investment at its orion assembly plant right here in michigan  come on  general motors  let's go  general motors gave us a little hard time with one building  i wasn't happy about that  that was the only building i had a problem within the whole car industry  right  right  you know the one i'm talking about  i didn't like that  anyway  but they're spending money  you know  what can i tell you  but these companies are coming in  a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to  i say  ""you have to  or we're not trading with you anymore "" because we had such big deficits with these countries  with japan  we had a  68 billion deficit  i said  shinzo  he's great prime minister of japan  but he said  ""but nobody has ever asked us to do this "" i said  ""i'm asking you "" they are building many  many plants  they're building many plants now in the united states  the japanese  and after years of rebuilding foreign nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  is that okay  we were surrounded with globalists  you know  they think it's okay  you open a plant in some country that you never heard of  they make your product  they send it  in the meantime  they close all their factories here  we're not doing that anymore  those are globalists  they think it's wonderful to have deficits  i don't  they think it's great  it's a great thing to have deficits  no  those are globalists  the globalists are passe   our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you  the american people  before anybody else  we must care for our own- we must care for our own citizens first democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent americans  i don't even know what's happening  it's terrible  and we've moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country  and we have agreements now with guatemala  honduras  el salvador  they didn't use to take them back  if we had a murderer  then we should get them the hell out  we don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50  60 years  we want to bring them back  they wouldn't take them  the planes used to go around and around  don't land  don't land  with us  they land  we worked out deals with every one of them  we stopped giving them all the aid  we're giving them all this money and then they said  ""we're not going to let you land  we're not going to let you take them back "" i said  ""that's okay  500 million  we were giving them  i said  now we give them  5 we give them nothing  all of a sudden they said  ""we would love to have them back "" we would love it  it's wonderful to have them back  in june  two illegal aliens in sandusky  michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife  then  they hid her body in a water drain  a criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death  a single mother of five young children  it's happening all the time  far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities  which deliberately release dangerous  violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets  we had a great election in north carolina recently  two great congressmen got elected  you don't hear about it  when they win  you don't ever hear about it  just a few months ago  two great people and they got elected and they got elected because i went in and said  ""talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities"" and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities  soon as i mentioned that  boom  they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great  great thing  the sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you  the people of california  they don't like sanctuary cities either  they're stuck with them because they have crazy politicians  earlier this year  authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of kent county  michigan  anybody know kent county  released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle  they let him go to roam free in michigan communities  if you want to end sanctuary cities in michigan  if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens  if you want to have a safe life  frankly  it's so crazy what they're doing  you wouldn't even believe it  you have only one choice in 2020  you must vote republican  thank you  i'm surprised  as you know  you do have sanctuary cities in michigan  i was almost surprised to hear it  but you have them  it's one of those progressive things  they think they're doing a wonderful favor for the world  and now we're getting these prosecutors that  you murder somebody  they give you two months  they fight that you don't even have to go to jail  what's going on is crazy  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossings are down 75% since may and we've ended catch and release  we've ended it  we could've ended it so easily  it's called the loophole  you catch him and then you release him into a country  that's what you had to do by law  and if you don't do that  they arrest the border patrol people  you believe this  the border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people  these are the people because look  when you have a caravan of eight or 10 000 people  a lot of those people  do you think that guatemala  honduras  el salvador  do you think they're sending us their finest  i don't think so  alright  how about the lottery  that was a schumer deal  chuck schumer  crying chuck  crying chuck schumer  i used to be a big contributor to him  he used to kiss my ass  chuck schumer  he'd do anything  he would've done anything for me  anything i asked him  get schumer on the phone  ""you do this  you do that  you get him on the phone  that son of a bitch "" he would have done  i didn't need anything  but he would have done anything  now it's like  ""the prisoner has not acted-""  give me a break  give me a break  find out how much money did i give a raise to chuck schumer and chuck  give all that money back please  carolyn maloney  give that money back  every penny should come back  they act so pompous  they act so righteous  they're not righteous  they're not righteous  they're bad people  the far left democrats have never been more extreme than they are now  democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor  180 million people are going to lose  a lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that's phenomenal  and that's what you want  they want to take it away  180  they want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night  i don't think so  not in this group  and you know what  some people  it's good so people  but can you imagine  they want to take away 180 million people  great  private  highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor  remember obama  28 times  ""you can have your doctor  you can have your plan "" didn't work out that way  did it  i think we should impeach him for that  let's impeach him  for that  for the irs scandal  for the guns  remember the guns  he was giving them to anybody that wanted them  he gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn't have them registered  right  not to good  impeach him  why didn't the republicans impeach him  those were really  how about giving around  1 8 billion in cash  how about that  by the way  i ended the iran nuclear deal  i hope you happy  much different country  but how about giving iran  1 8 billion in cash  many big planes going over to iran  loaded up to the ceiling with cash  you know what  1 8 billion  you ever see like at a casino   1 million wrapped up  it's a big pile of stuff  that's a million  now multiply it   1 8 billion in cash he gave  so  why is he allow to do that  did anybody try to impeach him for that  everybody knew it was wrong  republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the moment of birth  right  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  and that's what it is  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and the american dream  and that's really what it is  we're also the party of the great abraham lincoln  a lot of people forget that  but we have to bring it up  to protect the health and safety of our citizens  we awarded  100 million to improve water infrastructure in flint  how badly was flint  who were the geniuses that did that to you  you have clean water coming into flint  they had to pay a very tiny little fee  so instead  they go into this horrible  horrible  really polluted water and the water comes out of there  they spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks  and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people  it hurt the people  but we're getting it fixed  and i know your previous governor was a republican  but i was not a big fan of his  i was not  but i'm not a big fan of the one that can't fix the potholes either  we're committed to ensuring america has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth  and that's what it's about  it's about clean air and it's about clean  beautiful water  and it's about keeping our industry  not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord  how's paris doing  i don't think too well  how's paris doing with the yellow vests  the yellow vests  you know why  because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of  it's not working out too well  we're lowering prices  we're lowering taxes  we're making it possible  i mean  look at gas prices now  look at gas prices  i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  big deal  for years  you watched as your politicians apologized  member  ""i would like to apologize  i would like to apologize "" nah  we don't apologize  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of michigan  you're getting your auto industry back  at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation  if you want your children to grow up  a land of safety  it's really  we want a land of safety  justice  well  i don't know  when i look at those fbi reports we got out  we got to clean up a lot  what they've done to hurt people  what they've done to hurt with comey and these horrible people  what they've done to hurt people  i think one of the best things i did as president  a lot of people would say  ""with all what we've done for the economy and "" but one of the best things is firing james comey's ass out of there  boy  those reports are kept  did you see the other day  ""well  ah  ah "" first time now he said  in other words  he's 50% there folks  he's hit the golden pond  anyway  so what we're doing is  we're doing things that are going to make our victory  it's like a tree  we need that extra four years  we've done so much  even right to try  you know right to try  people were traveling  they're terminally ill  they're traveling all over the world  we have the best medical in the world  the best doctors  the best labs  best hospital  they're traveling all over the world  to try and get  because it takes years to get something approved  and i said  ""wait a minute folks  why aren't we doing this "" and they've been trying to do it for 49 years  they couldn't get it done  not that easy  the drug companies didn't want the liability  the country didn't want the liability  the insurance companies didn't want the liability  i said  ""here's what we do  we'll sign an agreement with the people where you're exculpated from all liability "" ""huh  that's a good idea "" and it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued  but i said  ""listen  they were worried they're going to hurt people "" i said  ""these people are terminally ill  they're terminally ill  and so we do it now "" nine months ago  all the legislators at the 49 years  so if somebody's sick  they don't have to go to asia  they're have to go to europe  or if you're poor  you go home and you die  now what happens  very simple  you sign that document  they work it out  you wouldn't believe how many lives are being saved  it's incredible  it's incredible  i'm very proud of it  right to try  i hope you don't need it  you don't want it  you don't want it  okay  but if you do  it's there  with your help  we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  we will enact the greatest trade deals ever made  they'll result in more products  proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  made in the usa  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  what we're doing is unbelievable  we're so far ahead of everybody  what we've done in the last three years with the fda and even the speed of what we're doing  it would take 12  13  14 years to get things approved  it's down to a much smaller number  but we're finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the aids epidemic in america  we've started the process  who would've thought that  in 10 years  it's a 10 year process  we will have ended the aids epidemic in america and it could have been been started before i came to office  it was just wasted time  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  they're incredible  and that includes ice  you know how tough these people are  these are great patriots  they love our country  even the sheriffs alone for  some of the people that they're dealing with  these guys walk into the golem's nest and in some cases they just swing it out  they can have it  they love it  these are great  if we didn't have them  and i told you before  they're taking out bad  bad  bad people by the thousands  especially ms13 gang members  who's going to do that  who's going to do that  anybody in the front row  i don't know  what about you  you're a tough guy  you might do it  you could do it  i don't know  you might  yeah  you can  what you like  we're going to recruit you  i think you could handle yourself  now  these are tough people  right  you got to be tough  then they get accused  they're too tough  oh  they're too tough  you have some of these guys  they knife people  they don't even need a gun because it's more painful  they knife the two young girls  16 years old  beautiful  they cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them  these are animals  and then nancy pelosi said  i shouldn't use the term animal  and by the way  she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the pacific ocean and into their beaches  she ought to go and take care of her district in san  do you see what's going on  and it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's  you know what  it's everything and it goes right into those storm sewers  storm  not sanitary  storm and it goes right out into the pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine los angeles and san francisco  but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing  and nancy pelosi is playing games  she ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything  san francisco was the most beautiful city  when you look at what's happened with the tents all over the place  where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat  they're getting sick  diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30  40  50 years  it's a disgrace  she ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there  they want to take everything down  they don't want thomas jefferson anymore  they don't want anything  that's a terrible thing and we fight for it  now  we fight  these words will never be taken off  i don't care where i am  if i'm up there  if i'm down here  i don't know  but we'll be fighting  we'll never take these words off  in god we trust  we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood  sweat and tears for this beloved nation  this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line  it's the place where general motors  chrysler and kellogg transformed the nation  it gave us motown  the mustang and the might of the american midwest  this is the american mid west  and michigan is the state where generations of strong  tough and proud american workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  and we are making it bigger  better and stronger than ever before  by far  loyal citizens like you help build this country  and together  we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  the democrats took the people of michigan for granted  but with us  you will never be forgotten again  the forgotten men and women of this country will never  ever be forgotten again  and i'm fighting for you  and i love doing it with everything that i have  and i will never  ever stop  and you know that  i will say i could have a much easier life  some people say  ""why is he doing it "" you know why i'm doing it because we're doing the thing and look what we're doing is we're bringing back our country again  we're respected again  we're respected again  we are so respected  you don't even know how respected  i went to nato where we were being ripped off because the other countries  you have 29 countries  and the other countries weren't paying their bills  they were delinquent in real estate  i noticed people are using that word  i've been using it for the last year  it's like a real estate trend  that's when they don't pay their rent  right  well  they weren't paying and you have to see this chart  until i got there  they got to pay and they said  ""well  does that mean you won't protect us "" i said  ""you don't want the answer to that question "" over the last  and the secretary general stoltenberg  over the last period of just two years  i raised  not from us  nothing from us   130 billion  but that's nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying  530 billion more  all of those countries  my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato  he says  ""i never thought this could "" i'm telling you  if you look  it's like 15 years just down  president obama would go there  make a speech  ""i'd like to thank everybody for being here  thanks  look  great job  sayonara  goodbye "" bush  they all did  nobody ever asked for money  we were spending for 100% of nato  we're protecting europe  they rip us off on trade  right  they rip us off like crazy  we lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade  we're changing that  but it's a long time  it's been going on a long time  they don't take your product  they don't take your cars  they don't take your farm product  they don't take your medical machines  we do a big business  they sell us  we don't sell them because they put restrictions  we have better equipment than them  but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify  it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers  it's brutal what they do  i'm telling you  they're as bad as china  just smaller  they are as bad as china  just smaller and now china's doing great  we're very happy  but we have to do something with that  we have to take care of our people  we can't be ripped off by these countries  so nato is ripping us off militarily  but now they're starting to pay big money and that's good  we want to help them  we want to be there with them  but they have to pay  they have to pay   530 billion and the fake news doesn't even want to talk about it  they don't want to talk about it  they talk about other things  they don't want to talk about that  when you'd get a chance though  just a couple of weeks  maybe you could say over a short period of time  nato countries will be paying  530 billion more  more  not total  more  how's that  good  that's not too bad  nobody else could do that  i guarantee  i won't tell you what took place in those closed door meetings  some of them don't like me  they like obama  germany likes obama  a lot of these countries  france  they like obama  it's embarrassing  in france  president obama is more popular than president trump  well  i should be  i just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they're ripping us off on the internet  okay  if i ever become more popular  that means i'm not doing my job  you should say he's out  it's true  i could be loved in germany  i could be loved in germany  oh  they'd love me  my father came from germany  parents and i could be loved in germany  they'd like me so much  but then i'm not doing my job for you  have to do it  have to do it  with your help  your devotion  your drive  we're going to keep on working  we're going to keep on fighting  we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning because we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation  under god  america is thriving like never before  and ladies and gentlemen of michigan  the best is yet to come  great state  great state  you better

1,18,Sep,2020,datasets/Bemidji,"there's a lot of people  that's great  thank you very much  thank you very much  that's a big group of people  this is on fast notice  too  thank you  but i'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful  great  hardworking people of this incredible state  you're really hardworking american patriots  that's what you are  and a lot of people haven't been treated right until i came along  we've done a lot of work and a lot of good work  and you had your best year ever last year  the state had the best year you've ever had  46 days from now  we're going to win minnesota  and we're going to win four more years in the white house  one of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees  you know it  you know it perhaps better than almost anybody  lots of luck  you're having a good time with the refugees  that's good  we want to have omar  he said omar  that's a beauty  how the hell did she win the election  how did she win  it's unbelievable  every family in minnesota needs to know about sleepy joe biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from somalia  from other places all over the planet  well  that's what's happened  and you like omar a lot  don't you  biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with bernie  right  a 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world  including yemen  syria  and somalia  congratulations  minnesota  a 700% increase  good luck  minnesota  enjoy yourselves  because if i'm not here  if i don't win  i don't know where i'm going to be  but maybe i'll come over to see mike  i'll come and see mike  your state will be overrun and destroyed  and biden and the radical left win  that's what's going to happen  i've been watching it for years  they haven't treated you right  they have not treated minnesota right  thank you  i'll tell you  these hangers are great  remember this  it's a friendly protest  please remember this is not a rally  you're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind  you're not allowed to go to church  you're not allowed to do anything  the only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets  burn down storefronts  blow up stores  and kill people  because that's considered a protest  and that  they allow you to have  you don't have to wear masks at protests  so i said  ""we can't have a rally  the most we can have is ten people  but why don't we just call it a protest ""  because this is a protest  it's a protest against stupidity  speaking about stupidity  sleepy joe will turn minnesota into a refugee camp  think of it  700% increase  so you're not happy now  look at that guy over there  he's not too thrilled when he hears this  700% increase is what they have in the manifesto  now  maybe they don't honor it  but i would say they'll go substantially higher than that number  biden will overwhelm your children's schools  overcrowd their classrooms  and inundate your hospitals  that's what'll happen  biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions  jihadist regions  they've already been doing that to you  haven't they  opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorists  my administration's keeping terrorists  extremists  and criminals the hell out of our country  we don't want them  we don't want them  we've got enough of them  we've got enough of them  just today  we deported  as you know very well  dozens of somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes  including rape  assault  robbery  terrorism  and murder  of course  these hardened criminals are back in their country  where they do all the complaining they want  and your children are much safer as a result  thank you  president trump  thank you  if it were up to biden  and it's not  it's the people that's around him  they are seriously radical left democrats  and they're very dangerous  the offenders are very dangerous  and they'd be running all over your state  only by voting for me are you going to say 窶ｦ but i hate to say this  and get it with your iron ore  i did it with some other things  and i'll do it for you again  i'll do it for you again  but if you vote for me  i'm the difference  and i'm the wall  you know the wall that we're building on the southern border  i'm your wall between the american dream and chaos  joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob  he has no clue where he is  this is not a sharp guy  years ago  i said to a certain senator who i was very friendly with  a democrat  ""who's the dumbest senator  who's the smartest senator "" he gave me a name for the smartest  i said  ""who's the dumbest "" ""oh  joe biden  you didn't know that "" that was 25 years ago  that was in prime time  this is no longer prime time for sleepy joe  they do disinformation  they make things up  and they make commercials  they make things up  i've never seen anything like it  everything  they make up  first of all  i'm the one protecting your social security  they say  ""trump"" 窶ｦ remember four years ago  they used to say  ""oh  trump will get rid of social"" 窶ｦ i have protected your social security  they're going to destroy your social security  remember  did you ever hear of a man  fiorello la guardia  did you ever  i don't think that happened with him  new york  i don't think it happened with rudy giuliani  did it  what a great job rudy did  you realize rudy's just now really being appreciated  people forgot how good he was as a man  he was a great mayor  we polled it  i'd go down about 22 points  they want to poll everything nowadays  i don't believe in polls  they poll everything  but ali velshi  i don't know anything about the guy  but i know he was standing there  this is really quite a good scene  it's a friendly protest  everyone's acting 窶ｦ and behind him  the entire city was burning  it's one of the great pictures of all time  the entire city was burning down  that was your city  and it's a shame it took so long  but the governor finally did it at least  if you take a look at portland  the governor can't quite do it  she can't get there  i speak to her all the time  ""come on  governor  i can straighten out portland  give me less than an hour  just let us have it for"" 窶ｦ because the state has to ask for it  they have to request  it's a shame  it's such a shame  but in your case  we went  and all of a sudden  it was really 窶ｦ that was going to be a bad night  too  right  remember that  about seven o'clock  then you see this guy walked out with about a  250 000 outfit on  that's because it had more computers and this and that  got the tear gas deal  he's got the whole deal  pepper spray  got everything  the finest outfit you can buy  believe me  we just paid for them  and they were very expensive  so we see one  the helmet  how about the helmet with the goggles  you can see at night  you can see at day  you can see whenever the hell you want  so there's one  i said  ""oh  that's only one guy "" then you see another three  then four  then you see another ten  they were just getting out of the buses  coming from very friendly territory  he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas  and he went down  he was down  ""my knee  my knee "" nobody cared  these guys didn't care  they moved them aside  and they just walked right to 窶ｦ it was the most beautiful thing  and that would be it  but so they had four or five lines  then they had lines of different 窶ｦ everybody did the same thing  did they ever even move one step back  i don't think so  right  it was just a slow walk right forward  then they just started walking faster  faster  faster  put a lot of guys in jail  tom  right  put a lot of guys 窶ｦ great congressman  by the way  put a lot of guys in jail  great  not good  great  they put a lot of guys in jail that night  tom  and that was the end of it  i don't think he had any problem after that  if you had any flare-ups  we'll send them in again  but that's all you do  these are democrat-run disasters  look at chicago  look at portland  look at you with minneapolis  these are disasters  by the way  are they still trying to get rid of your police force in minneapolis  that's what i heard  see  they never learn  they never learn  they don't 窶ｦ you've got a lot of people here  that's a lot of people  i actually like these  we have the arenas  we've always filled them up  it's been great  and the arenas are good  but usually you have to travel 45 minutes  this thing  you have a hangar  the plane becomes your backstop  right  it's like your curtain  it's a curtain  you get a free curtain  we're outside  which actually makes people happy  it even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy  because outside is better  it's better  and we're rounding the turn on covid  by the way  our vaccines are coming  a lot of things are happening  we're rounding the turn  we've done a great job  we've done a phenomenal job  we don't get credit for that  but we'll discuss that in a minute  but when you look at it  when you look at it  our country is amazing  it's an amazing country  we love this country  and we're not going to let radical left socialist/communists take over our country  okay  they use the word socialist  and socialists aren't great  but communists are a hell of a lot worse  and that's where we'd be headed  we're standing in the way of them  this group of people  but you have a lot of groups of people just like this  every place we go  last night  you know where we were  you saw that it was all over the place  right  that's a big state  that's a great state  then i see the fake polls  i just saw a poll here  minnesota  i'm down nine  i don't think so  i mean  i just don't think so  i don't think so  right  i don't think so  it's the craziest thing i've ever seen  this is the craziest thing i've seen  president trump is down nine in minnesota  now i just saw another plane  see the plane  the good thing about these beautiful air force ones  right  that's the smaller version of air force one  i think you had a little bit short runway  so they take the smaller to save about  12  no  they took the smaller one  but the great thing about those beautiful planes  they have more televisions than any plane in history  we have televisions in the closet  on the ceilings  on the floors  i've never seen them on the 窶ｦ we have them all over the place  and i'm just coming out  they said  ""there he is "" they said  ""it's a smattering of people "" they called it a smattering  they always do that  yet biden with the circles  right  the little circles  he's got like four people in a circle  you know why he does the circles  because he can't draw a crowd  so they put a circle  like he's supposed to 窶ｦ he's trying to be legitimate  he's going to go by the science  he always says science  he doesn't know what the word science is  so to have these four or five circles  they put people  that way he doesn't have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40  50 people  they had one not so long ago  and you saw this  he couldn't draw a crowd  it was a big thing  it was his opening or something  couldn't draw a crowd  so they made it a round table  so he went in  they only had like 32 people  they said  ""this is very embarrassing "" one of his people  and that's what they do  they're good  some of the people surrounding him  they'll say anything and do anything  they said  ""let's not make it a speech  there's nobody here  let's make it a round table "" so these people are sitting at a table  they had no idea  and most of them didn't know anything about politics  they didn't even know why they were there  now they're sitting on a round table  and they're on television  but that's what it is  but they say we had a smattering of people  yes  smattering of about what  15 000 people in about two days' notice  this doesn't include the 10 000 people  mike  that they turned away  i hate that they turned them away  you'd think with an airport  you wouldn't have to turn anybody away  but they have a certain amount  then sometimes you have democrats running an airport  and they don't like all these people here  that's true  they don't like it  but if we're up to biden  your state would be in ruins  just take a look at what they've done  and i'm going to hit it hard  they make phony commercials about me  and it gives me the right  how about the worst one of all  the worst i've ever seen  standing on a grave of a fallen soldier  and then they had some guy  a source said 窶ｦ there's no source  the source doesn't exist  they make it up  and then they take it  it's called disinformation  you're not supposed to do that  i'm not even sure if he knows  he's too weak to understand  and he's still weak to control his people  but it allows me to say whatever i want about this guy  the truth is  he's not fit to be your president  he's not mentally fit  if biden's elected  extremists  like representative ilhan omar 窶ｦ whatever happened to her  you had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her  she's done so many criminal acts  isn't it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it  i have to say to myself  i say  ""how the hell did she get away with that  if we do one"" 窶ｦ look at general flynn  he didn't even lie  they said he didn't lie  right  he's gone through hell  he's gone through hell  this guy wrote page after page of criminal acts  well  let's see what happens  who the hell knows  but between her and how about aoc  aoc- aoc is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house  right  joe crowley  i knew him a little bit  i asked him once i said  ""are you campaigning against this maniac "" he said  ""no  she's just a young girl  no problem "" i called him on election night  nah  i was going to  i was going to say  ""how did that work out  joe  that didn't work "" he was going to be speaker of the house  he's got a certain talent  but you know she had no money  nothing  and all of a sudden she had  2 000 000 and she spent the  2 000 000 all over the place  her and her boyfriend  whatever happened to her  can you imagine if i'd do that  you have to look at that  she spent the  2 000 000 and big story  but that was it  that's one quick story  oh man  probably the guy who wrote the story  lost his job at the new york times  right  he's now unemployed  but there's a big story  she spent  2 000 000 on bullshit  if a republican did that they'd be in jail  you know that  it's a different standard and it's a disgrace  and our guys better get on the ball  look  let me tell you how about yesterday  they were talking about russia  russia  russia  again  here we go with the russia  there's never been anybody so tough on russia with the sanctions  remember obama would send pillows  i sent tank busters right to ukraine  i'm the one that exposed the pipeline with germany  germany pays them billions and billions of dollars  and then we're supposed to protect germany from russia  i said  ""how does that work  how does that work  you're spending billions of dollars for energy to russia "" it's all okay  i'm the one that exposed it  what i've done 窶ｦ hey  they don't want me to go  but if you look  they don't want me to win  russia doesn't want 窶ｦ maybe north korea does because i actually have a very good relationship with him  and speaking of north korea and you know  it's okay to have really  you don't have to go to wars  we don't have to lose our great soldiers  it's good  if i got along with putin  somebody said ""he gets along well with putin "" i'm saying to myself  ""but isn't that sort of a good thing  is that bad "" ""he gets along with putin  that's a bad thing "" but you saw the head of the fbi yesterday started going russia  russia is looking at our election  russia  here we go again  russia  russia  russia  i said  ""what about china  what about north korea  what about iran  what about 窶ｦ "" they don't mention anybody else  the narrative seems to be russia  millions of phone calls made not one to russia  millions of phone calls received not one to russia  then he goes  ""russia  russia "" then they asked him about antifa  what do you think about antifa  ""well  it's an ideology "" i said  ""no  it's not  it's a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is "" it's unbelievable  unbelievable when you look at this stuff  but seriously  take a look at the aoc  i call it aoc plus three  her three people that she tells what to do  and  2 000 000  dresses  rent  other things  you're not supposed to do that  mr  congressman  are you allowed to do that sir  you don't do that  you don't buy dresses do you  if he does that's the end of his career right  no  but it's terrible  right john  it's terrible  will prosecute him  i mean  why not  i don't understand it  i'll tell you what  one friend of mine  very sophisticated guy  very successful guy called me up  he says  ""you know  from the day you came down the escalator with our great first lady  our future first lady "" he said ""from that day the people love her  she gave a great speech at the republican national convention at the white house  she gave a great speech "" but said ""from the day you came down the escalator with our first lady  from the single day you've been under investigation  you've been under investigation by sleazebags  people that now we caught  cleaned up their phones "" you're not allowed to do that  right mr  congressman  my great hockey player  you're the greatest  right  but you're not allowed to do that  you know  we want their phones  ""oh  here they are  oh  by the way  they happen to be totally deleted "" like hillary with the 33 000 emails she deleted  if she is  she's not getting her money worth  her yoga lessons and her daughter's wedding  right  so it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons  so i said  ""okay  let's give her five or six each "" what do you think  mike  five or six each  five for the wedding  make it 30  make it a hundred  make it a thousand  a thousand for the wedding  and for the yoga  let's give her 200  okay  what about all those thousands and thousands of emails  probably classified  so congress 窶ｦ so forget about it  let's assume they're gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them  and then she hit her phones with a hammer  i get rid of phones  i've never hit him with a hammer  not even as president  i say  ""yeah  throw the phone away "" no  no  i've never hit a phone  has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it  i don't think so  so she gets a subpoena from the u s congress  not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you're fighting and you're fighting or something  by the way you do that  you've got problems in court  big problems  but she gets a subpoena from congress  u s  subpoena  the most important subpoena you can get  they get the subpoena  and after she gets the subpoena  by a few days everything is deleted  her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped  and everything's gone  and nothing happens to her  forget about what was on  now think of how angry it makes me when i see it  now how angry  could you imagine if i'd do that it's a whole different ball game  know how angry it makes me when i see it  and we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue  that was my fault  i was loyal to somebody  endorsed me early  you know whey he endorsed me  because i went to mobile  alabama  we had 55 000 people show up at a stadium  he said  ""i'd like to endorse you "" then after we won  he said  ""i'd love to be attorney general "" and i said  ""no  i don't think so "" but after four or five times asking  i'm a loyal person and i did it  the mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty  but that's okay  but allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace  maybe there's something they can do  so forget about looking for the emails  and they are available  and i guarantee they're in the state department  i guarantee you they're in the state department that ought to damn well find them  they're being protected in the state department  but forget about that  almost as good is the fact that you're not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay  kendall should pay  equal consequence  equal consequence  equal  but that's the way it is  but we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on  i said to myself  ""i'm going to stay uninvolved  i don't have to  chief law enforcement officer  can you believe it  but i think it's better if i stay uninvolved "" and i have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent attorney general  bill barr  and i'll be honest  he's a smart guy  i think he's getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day  i think he's not going to put up with this stuff  i don't think  and you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters  whatever you want to call them  they fight him at every turn  they fight him  fight him  fight him  but he's getting tougher and tougher  i watched over the last three days  i'm saying  ""wow  that's sort of what we're all waiting for  right "" but she deletes her emails  aoc gets rid of  2 000  000  gets rid of it  nothing happens  nothing happens  and then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we  and she controls nancy pelosi  actually nancy pelosi would love to get rid of her i think  how about pelosi  pelosi goes out and says  ""you know  i think i have my hair done "" so she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor  i told the story in wisconsin last night  by the way  we had that great crowd in wisconsin  you have a feeling about places  you know the problem with minnesota is that i think since 1972  this hasn't been won by a republican  so  you're a little behind the eight ball when you hear that  right  i mean  i can understand  and wisconsin rarely  but i won wisconsin  unlike minnesota thank you very much  thank you very much  tom  thank you  unlike minnesota  but it's my fault  so i had one speech left  it started at one in the morning  i went to michigan  we won michigan  that was another one  great state  we brought back so many auto companies into michigan  we brought them back  but i had one  it was already voting day  it was election day  because by the time i got there it was just scheduled  had i made that one damn stop to your state we would have won minnesota  i lost by what  a half a point  half a point  but i get off the plane and they said  ""he's in minnesota  he's down nine "" the recent poll  down nine  i believe it's a suppression poll  and you know  i have an instinct about things pretty much  somebody said ""trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years "" one of my enemies said that  and i said  ""no  i don't "" i don't believe i do  i think i have lousy political instincts "" but what am i going to tell you  let me just say they said that  and i was very impressed by the statement  in fact  i went to my wife i said  ""you know  they say i have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years "" and i said  ""but i don't believe it  i don't "" i don't want to be beto  remember beto  ""i was born to run for president "" that was the end of his career  beto o'rourke who's in charge of guns  by the way  he's going to take your guns away  you know that  right  biden  sleepy joe  sleepy joe is going to take your guns away  remember beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine  i won't mention the name  they've got a lot of bad magazines out there  the good news is most of them are dying  if not all of them  but beto o'rourke  he did the story and he was going to defeat ted cruz  he was going to do all these things  ted beat him  and i helped a lot too  i was with ted all the way  and i think ted's appreciated it  but i even said  ""i'm putting ted cruz as one of the people for the supreme court "" right  and you know why i did it  you know why i did it  because i wanted to make sure that i had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people  unbelievable  the smartest  the best  the absolute creme de la creme  right  the best minds in the country  conservative  they believe in the constitution  little things like that  but i said  ""you know  i have to have somebody that we're going to make sure we get approved "" and the only one i could think of is ted  because he's going to get 50 republican votes and he's going to get 50 democrat votes  they'll do anything to get them out of the senate  right  so anyway  but just to finish  there's no way that i'm nine points down  i look at a crowd  so they say instinct  right  so i look at a crowd and whether i have good instinct or not  this is not the crowd of somebody that's going to finish second in the state to a sleepy joe  finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together  now it is an ideology  it doesn't matter  i could put that broken piece of wood right there  i could put that out  and it's the same thing as joe  it's just an ideology  it's just an idea  now  historically  we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they've ever opposed  you heard that  like 36 points  in other words  they've got no enthusiasm for him  i have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell  but he does have enthusiasm to beat trump  his only enthusiasm is put anybody in there  right  put anybody in there  he does have enthusiasm to beat trump  nothing for him  but to beat trump  okay  but historically that never wins  when somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you  people respect you 窶ｦ and sean hannity did something the other night  he said to this man  ""if you owned a mcdonald's hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area  would you have joe biden running that stand "" the answer is no  he doesn't have the energy  he doesn't  so he can't run the country  no  seriously  i thought it was good  i never thought of it  you wouldn't have him running your business  you wouldn't have him running a mcdonald's  i have to say or a wendy's  i have a friend he owns wendy's  he always gets up  ken  you haven't mentioned wendy's  okay  but you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it  and yet he's running for the presidency  he's got no energy  i made a comment that somebody had low energy  that was the end of his political career  but joe's energy is far lower  it's far lower  no  it's far lower than jeb  jeb was on the low side  but joe  he's off the scale  right  joe's got nothing going  today biden delivered remarks  barely  to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to china and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash  how about his statement  hey  we talk about aoc being crooked  she's a hundred percent crooked  okay  but were talking about that  look at omar  she came in here  did she marry her brother  where's that writer  that writer should be given the pulitzer prize  he never will be  he should be though  you know the amazing thing  all of these writers  new york times  washington post  right  russia  russia  russia  trump  russia  russia  russia  i had 19 people  all brilliant  all radical left  all hillary people  actually not even a never trumper from bush  okay  all hillary clinton people mostly  almost everyone  they were all democrats  how about this  you're being investigated by 19 democrats that are smart people  okay  smart people  so my friend says  ""you know  you are the most honest person in the world  and you've taken three years of total investigation "" you don't think they've gone over my taxes  they went over at the biggest tax firm in the country  the most prestigious  they went over everything  they spend 48 million as it comes out now  it's about  48 000 000 investigating me before i won and after i won  and we caught them spying on my campaign  that's what they were really doing  and now with the phones  i think there's like 22 or 24 people  you heard this one  they said  ""no  no  no  we made a mistake when we deleted our phone "" you know what they had to do to make that mistake  like 19 different formulas  right  i don't even know how you delete a phone  i didn't know you could do it  but they all made the exact same mistake  that's not good  that's not good  so let's see what happens to them  it's a criminal act you know that  right  it's a criminal act  it's criminal  weissman's a bad guy  put a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail  weissman  he's a bad guy  he's on cnn all the time or msnbc which i call it msdnc  because it's the same thing  owned by a company called concast  did anyone ever hear 窶ｦ with an n  not an m  con like a con job  concast  they a fortune on public relations  comcast has delivered you the news  all the news  and they spend a fortune  and then i go up and make one speech and i call them concast and that's the end of the pr for the year  they are a bad group of people  they're sick  i mean  they're sick people  they're sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don't report the news  you know  in the old days  when you used public airways free  you had to get a license  i keep saying  ""if they're reporting fake news  how come they can keep getting a license "" whether it's abc  whether it's nbc  cbs  or of course  cnn  which is i mean one of the great jokes of all time  cnn  or msdnc  but they're cable so i guess there's a different standard  but when you're using the public airwaves free  okay  free  aren't you supposed to get licensed  so i asked my people that  i ask a couple of guys and i never really get an answer  i just want to know a simple question  do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else  and i never get the right answer because there are people down deep  it's crazy  but we're getting down to all of it  a lot of progress has been made  i think you're starting to see it  we're trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people  you know i came to washington 窶ｦ think of it  think of it  i came to washington and i had 24 years of putting people in office  and then you can probably add another four to that  and another four to that  i had many  many years  decades of people putting 窶ｦ so i came  been to washington i guess 17 times i never stayed over  right  never slept over  i was there 17 times  but we're riding down the beautiful pennsylvania avenue  and i look outside at those police  i love our police  we've got to treat our police better  i had everything  i had police  i had military  i had soldiers  i had everything you could possibly have  you never saw so much how power and strength and beauty  the beauty  and they were so proud  they're all saluting  they're so proud  they're happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us  they're proud  they're great  the police  you know  every single police force i think endorsed me  i got the one yesterday from chicago  that's not easy  chicago endorsed me  new york's finest endorsed me  florida  ohio  i mean  everybody  i don't know that he's gotten one vote  then he says he can't mention the words law and order  can you believe it  and then i get to the most beautiful house in the world  i can have mar-a-largo and all of them  but i'll tell you the white house is still the white house  no matter how you do it  and i get to this gorgeous  beautiful place  and i'm up at the incredible suite level and there's abraham lincoln's suite  it's called the lincoln bedroom  remember clinton used to lease it out to people for money  they never change do they  remember when barbara streisand  she's another beauty  by the way  but remember barbara streisand used to stay in that suite  which was the only problem i had with it  but tell me 窶ｦ no  but i do like her voice  i do  i really do  some of them i don't like even their voices  but she used to stay there  and i'm standing in the lincoln bedroom  the history of the whole thing  the bed  the desk  the gettysburg address  the beautiful four score and seven years ago  this beautiful gettysburg address  he wrote it there  and also on his carriage ride up to gettysburg  he delivered the gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than i did was abraham lincoln  did anyone ever hear that  and i said  ""no way they got worse  maybe he got bad  but no way he gets worse "" now people are starting to say  ""it's probably true  i think you've got the worst "" now they used to say  ""no  no "" newt gingrich  great guy  he said  ""nope  abraham lincoln got the worst press  they were worse to him than anybody  he was a very depressed person  his wife was very depressed "" it was a depressed kind of a thing  he's in a war  he's in a revolution  and he was getting beaten a lot by robert e  lee  they want to rip his statue down all over the place  but robert e  lee whether you like statues or not  they don't rip statues down anymore  i signed a law  10 years in jail if they rip them down  but robert e  lee won many  many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day  it was supposed to end immediately because the north was too powerful for the south  but it just shows when you have leaders  when you have a great general  and robert e  lee  he would have won except for gettysburg  and that was because his general was killed who's going to lead gettysburg  never fight uphill  me boys  never fight uphill  he heard they were going up hill  stop them  stop them  but we had no cell phones in that day  right  congressmen  no cell phones  so they sent the horses to stop him  stop him  but it was too late  they fought uphill and they got slaughtered  that's what happened  but robert e  lee these were incredible things  but i hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments  and i said to my people four months ago  i said  ""this is crazy  these people "" and they don't even know  they started ripping down abraham lincoln  when they hit lincoln i said  ""wait a minute  this is the man  and you can't do 窶ｦ"" then they hit george washington  thomas jefferson  they hit everybody  they even had gandhi  all gandhi wanted was one thing  peace  may we have peace  rip down the statue we don't like it  i don't think they have any idea what they're doing  i think they're just a bunch of thugs  okay  you want to know that  i think they are a bunch of thugs  they were going to march on washington and they were going to rip down a statue of abraham lincoln  you know the exact statute  its up very nicely  up now  and by the way  they can take them down legally  they go through congress as a way of doing it  but they didn't want to do it that way  and they were marching on washington  and i said  ""do we have any laws about this "" they said  ""no  sir "" now in congress  the way it is now  the most you get is about a  10 fine  you rip down a  5 million statue and you got a  10 fine  right  it's different world  that's when it was strong and they had laws  but we told and found this old act  and the old act said  if you rip down a monument or a statue  you get 10 years in prison  they call it prison  not jail  which sounds even worse  i said  ""bring that sucker up immediately to the oval office because there are a lot of people coming to washington "" they were going to march on the jefferson memorial  do you believe that  the jefferson memorial  we grow up 窶ｦ the jefferson memorial  they were going to march on the jefferson memorial  they were going to do damage to our beautiful jefferson memorial after thomas jefferson  and i did predict that  a friend of mine said  ""you know  two years ago you said  next will be robert e  lee and then comes washington  and jefferson and lincoln  they'd never stop  the only thing they understand is strength  remember that "" they don't understand weakness  there's nothing you can do  these really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars  it's like blackmail money  right  but these stupid people that run  they get  40 000 000 a year and they're weak  okay  they're weak  but these people  they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength  so i said  ""let me see this document "" i said  ""wow  this is a very strong document "" and derek is here  one of my attorneys  he did a great job  i don't know where the hell derek is  he's around here  actually he's heard this before though  not quite  you're getting a very unique speech tonight  you know  i mean unlike joe  i haven't even looked at the teleprompter  this guy will ""move it up  move it up  i can't see  move it up "" i haven't looked at it  the poor teleprompter guy he's sitting there ""what do we do  we're on line two of the teleprompter "" he said  ""what do we do "" no  unlike joe  i have not looked at the teleprompter  oh  that poor joe  you know what's the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter  the worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions  right  like donna brazil  who was brilliantly hired by fox  fox has changed a little bit  ladies and gentlemen  donna brazil  who was fired by cnn because she cheated and she gave crooked hillary the questions to the debate  how would you like to be me  they give her questions to the debate  and i still won the debate and she had all the questions  think of it  how do you do that  donna brazil is  ladies and gentlemen  she's going to work for fox  oh  that's great  that's big difference  big difference between four years ago and now  a lot of things have changed  but i'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago  it's amazing right  but just to get back to the others  so i signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law  and it says 10 years  it doesn't say  you get 10 years  but you can take it down to three weeks  it says 10 years  so these guys had just gotten there  i had a news conference because i had to let them know about it  right  we've got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down  no  but i looked at the andrew jackson right  with the ropes  and i'll tell you  the police did a great job  and mark meadows did a great job  he said  ""charge "" they charged  and they took these guys out and they were fairly tough  but the police were much tougher  dc police  they did a great job  they were watching and they weren't able to do anything  mark meadows said ""charge "" it was like from 200 years ago it was crazy  they charged and they'd beat the hell out of these guys  or you wouldn't have that great statue on the horse of a great general  he was a great general  and he was a very good president  at least a good president  but he was a great general  the battle of new orleans  right  he went to jail too  we had all the evidence we needed  thank you for that  i want to thank you fake news  we called the fake news  we said ""can we just have that please "" when they said  no  we just said  ""we'll take it off tivo  that's okay  don't worry about it "" one of the greatest inventions in history  tivo better than television because television is useless without it  so  we signed it  and all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it  they left  nobody showed up the next day  they're going to have 25 000 people  they had 24 people  5 of them were brought to prison  okay  and the next day they said  ""well  we were going to save it for saturday night "" and saturday night nobody showed up  and nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue  it's true  because you know why  they look and they say  ""i want to take down that statue  i'm going to take down that statue  that statue's coming down "" and then somebody says  ""you know it's 10 years in jail "" they go  ""that's too much  i'm getting out of here "" it's true  ten years is not acceptable  mike  right  ten years is a lot to rip down a statue  have a little fun  especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down  but we have an idea what they're ripping down  they're ripping down in many cases  greatness  they're ripping down our past  they're ripping down our history  and that's where these guys begin  they take away your history  you look at the middle east  you look all over  look what isis did  look what all of them do  they go down and they rip  they go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything  they want to take away your past  they're not taking away the past of the united states of america  not as long as i'm here  what do you want  do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody  okay  here's the question  my poor guy must be having a fit  he's over there  he's so good at this stuff  he's on line three  窶ｦ good at this stuff  he's on line three  he said  ""sir  should i use turn the sucker off  would you rather go teleprompter or freelance "" isn't it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either  see  joe doesn't have the option  he doesn't have the option  but if biden wins  china wins  and it's very simple  it's very simple  by contrast  i rescued the minnesota iron range  i did that  just so you know  o-biden  i call him o-biden  it's too long to say obama and biden  so i just go  o-biden  because i don't care about窶ｦ everyone said  ""oh no  he's in trouble  obama's now campaigning "" hey  he campaigned last time harder than hillary  i said  ""no  i want him to campaign because he brings out the base "" he brings out our base  and i'm only here because of him and joe  i'm only here because of him  i could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury  and here i am at the hangar in minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25 000 people  and thousands of people that couldn't get in  and i'm working my ass off  i could be at home having a good time  wonderful time  but the one thing i said is- we want trump  we want trump  we want trump  but i say this  i say this look  i could be home  so home was new york  i had to bail out because it was too crazy  everything has fallen apart  but home  it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great new york  between a governor and a mayor  the crime is through the roof  the corruption is incredible  it's a sad thing that's happened to new york  hopefully it'll come back by somebody  somebody will go in there and do like a rudy  you know when rudy took over  it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy  but somebody has to go in and clean it up  this mayor  he let go of a billion dollars worth of police  he actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police  and they're all going to do it  they're all going to do it  and new york people are going to do it  i'm being totally serious now  you've got to go out and you've got to vote for trump  you got to break this spell from 1972  you saw kenosha  what we did for other places  you saw the kenosha  and that was gone  that was all gone  that place was gone  we sent in the troops  it was incredible what we did  and they did it on day three  day three is better than two weeks later  like in minneapolis  but they did it  and we've done a great job and the people of that great state  they understand it  and i just hope the people of your state of minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff  we really don't  we don't have the luxury of sitting back and saying  ""let's have four years of this maniac  vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person  that's why i say the one person that he won't pick窶ｦ my great instincts  right  the one person he won't pick is kamala because she called him a racist  she tried to me-too him  he was me-too'd  ""i've just been me-too'd darling  what does that mean "" but they tried to me-too him  and she was the one that brought it up  remember tara  she was the one that brought it up  and then he goes  ""ladies and gentlemen  i'd like to pick窶ｦ wait a minute  let me get her name here  how do you pronounce it  it's with a comma  like a comma  right  like a comma "" remember he couldn't pronounce her name  he was saying her name wrong  and she had to interrupt him  no  my name is kamala  like comma  i remember that  like a comma  h1n1  that's right  joe  remember that joe  h1n1  and how bad did he do in that though  how about that  how bad did he do  so come to think of it  he's out there now today  it was pathetic  by the way  did you see the anderson cooper thing last night  you have to watch  i don't want to watch  but i have an obligation  i'm competing against somebody  you don't want to compete and say  ""i'm not going to watch my competition  who wouldn't "" it's boring  but i got to watch  and he got through it  he met a couple of really窶ｦ the chicken thing was bad  he said chicken many  many times  and it was a little strange that i thought it was over and he pulled it back  he was able to pull it back  but anderson is a窶ｦ and he interviewed me  he's tough  you know  he can be tough  nothing against him  he could be very tough  but last night he was in rare form  he was  ""thank you very much for being here  mr  vice president  are you enjoying the run "" and compare that with my shot  where they asked me about doing abc with george stephanopoulos  i think it was great  i think it worked out great  you know what i call it  debate prep  i call that free debate prep  but you know it's nasty  it's a little nasty that people窶ｦ and i didn't say  ""no  you got to change the rules  no  give me the questions  i want to use a teleprompter to answer "" how about that though  mr  vice president  i'd like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to china and russia and where are they in the race  well  you can't have this as your president  i don't care  forget about me  you can't do this  the importance and the power of this position are too great  you can't do it  i've learned a lot as president  but one thing i learned is that president xi of china is sharp  you ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front  everybody's the same height  they're wearing hats  everyone's like a pool table  right  and he's standing there by himself  and he's looking like he's not playing games  there's no games  he's sharp as you can be  and i had a great relationship  but now i feel differently  we made a great trade deal  and now i feel differently  but he's a sharp as you can be  putin as sharp as you can be  kim jong un  we would have been in a war with north korea 100%  i asked obama  ""did you ever call him "" he said that was the toughest problem we had  and we get along  remember about a month ago  two months ago  they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said  ""oh  he's going to attack "" i said  ""no  he's not  don't worry about it "" i got to know him very well  we have a good relationship  people said  ""he has a good relationship with kim jong un  that's terrible "" i said  ""no  that's good "" but you remember it was going to be a nuclear war  and i got along with him  then they said  ""trump made a terrible deal  he's given so much to north korea "" what did i give  i was at like a semi debate with his idiot  a reporter  ""he's given a lot to north korea "" ""what did i give "" ""i don't know "" sanctions  sanctions  you took away  no  i didn't  actually  i increased the sanctions very substantially  what did you give  what did i give  tell me  so after about four days they couldn't ask because i gave nothing except i gave heart because i don't want to see people killed on their side either  i don't want to see people killed  we'd win that  we'd win them all  we have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man  we've rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible  and then the fake news  and i said that a couple of weeks ago  remember i said  ""we have created the most powerful weapons known to man "" it's true  we have weapons that are so advanced that president xi  putin  everybody  we're the envy of the world  but they don't know quite what we have  but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before  and some schmuck back there said  ""i think he's given away classified information "" now  all i'm doing is telling the world  we have the most powerful weapons in the world  i'm not even saying what kind  you don't even want to know about it  and god help us if we ever have to use them  but we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man  they have the missile  the super-duper  hydro sonic  i call it the super-duper  it goes five times faster than a normal missile  right  we have one goes much faster than that  but russia got that information from the obama administration  russia stole that information  you knew that  russia got the information and they built it  but we have now one that's much faster than that  that's like a slow missile  that's like considered a slow missile  but i said it was incredible  two weeks ago i said  ""we have the finest  the best  the most incredible  sadly  the most deadly  and we never want to use it  but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10  by a factor of 10 "" and they went crazy  ""he's given away classified "" these people are sick  all i'm doing is saying that we rebuilt our military  2 5 trillion all built in the usa  every single ounce of it  we have fighter jet  f-35 that are so good  you can't see it  and i went to see the program  and i met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than tom cruise  they're tougher  they're stronger  they're bigger  they're more powerful  they're smarter  and i like tom cruise by the way  because you can't get much better than top gun  right  great movie  you can't get better  i like tom cruise  but these guys are better looking than tom  they got that crew cut  they got the crap under their eyes  they got the whole deal  they're smart as hell  so i said  ""so captain  let me ask you  how good is the f-35 "" ""they're really good sir  best plane we've ever had all great "" i said  ""how do you compare that with what russia has "" ""well  ours is better for a specific reason  sir  you can't see it "" ""what does that mean "" ""well  when we fight  they cannot see us  that we are so stealth "" now that doesn't mean in three years that it won't be obsolete because that's what happens  that's the problem with that business  you come up with a new computer and two weeks later it's obsolete  that's why i always like real estate  and grab a piece of real estate  but no  it's true  i wouldn't be good in that business  you get to work  work  work  and then you're starting the next one because the last one is gone  that's why i always talk about walls and wheels  when the democrats were saying  ""walls are old fashioned "" well  they're right about that  but they work  remember that  all we had to go through in congress  and that wall is going up  think of that  we're building 10 miles a week  10 miles a week of the top  and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been  the best they've ever been  well  we're building 10 miles of wall a week  we're up to about 330 miles  and we'll have it finished very soon  and it's having a tremendous impact on drugs  it's having a tremendous impact on all of the different things  human trafficking in women  it's not even children  they're trafficking women  it's because of the internet  you think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime  right  but it's not  it's a very modern crime and it's an unbelievably profitable crime  they're trafficking women  little bit children  but mostly women  where they'll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they'll go through the border  they can't do it anymore  and we're catching them  we have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers  to me  the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world  and thank heavens for ice  and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want  i know mike doesn't want it  you wouldn't even be good at it  mike  he'll do a commercial about it  that's what he'll do  does he have the longest commercials in history  i say  mike lindell  i say  mike  the pillow man  i say  mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history  i want him to buy my commercials  i say  ""you know  we spent  20 million  i sell like two commercials "" he spends  2 and he's got the whole day on fox  i said  let mike buy our commercials  will you  i don't know what the hell you do  but whatever it is  you better tell me the secret  greatest purchaser of commercials  but we have done some job with that  and the traffickers and drugs are way down  now we got upset with the pandemic  but i watched biden today talking about  ""if only trump moved one week sooner  one week "" so let's go  ready  so  you know he was against the ban  right  because he didn't think we had a problem  so he was against the ban  he didn't know that china was heavily infected  he doesn't even know where china is  in my opinion  but he was against the ban  these guys write stuff out for him  and he tries to read it  doesn't do well with it  so he was against it  but now his new thing is  if only i moved one week earlier  but i was earlier than everybody  if you think about it  i had nice guy  dr  fauci  i had another nice  got a lot of doctors  they were all telling me  ""no  no  you don't have to do that "" tom knows that very well  ""you don't have to do that  sir  you don't have to do that  you don't have to do that at all "" and one of those things  i was very early and i banned and everybody admits that had i not banned highly infected wuhan province  right  highly infected  we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths  and then you had the chart  i put it up yesterday  i'm doing these news conferences  we're finally getting the word across that we did a great job  but i'm doing news conferences now every day  i call them the highly rated news conferences  and i go before these crazy people  they're screaming like maniacs  it's not the way they treat sleepy joe  he'd melt  if they ever did a number on  this guy would be there he'd be laying on the floor crying  ""get me out of here  darling  where is my wife  get me out of here  please  darling  they're so nasty to me today  what happened "" we go through it every single day  but you think about it  and he said  ""if only trump moved faster "" but he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic  and he called me a racist because i was banning china  which was heavily infected  and then he said  ""don't ban europe "" well  i looked at italy  big problem  i love italy  i love the people of italy  but they were heavily infected  france  i looked at france  i looked at spain  they even had spikes recently  did you see  and we're doing great  we're rounding it with or without  but we're going to have with  but you know  with his better  but with or without  we're rounding that corner  and we're rounding it fast and they don't want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up 'til november 4th  and on november 4th  the press will probably say  let's say something stupid happened  the press will say  ""i got to admit he did a damn good job "" and the other clown will be in office  we did a thing called price transparency  i signed it  it's effective  also very complicated  it's on your medical  and we did price transparency  it's the biggest thing  it's bigger than healthcare  where you see your prices  you can go now to hospitals  you can price operations  you can price everything  it's a massive thing  the man who did it窶ｦ and i took a lot of heat  and i'm doing favorite nations drugs  meaning whatever the lowest in the world is  we have to pay the same  that's the good news  the bad news is the drug companies  the doctors everybody's angry at me  actually under price transparency  the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously  but the bad ones don't  and you have price transparency  and it goes into effect on january 1st  could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like  february  march  april something  they say unbelievable what happened to prices  it's dropping like crazy  and they'll say  what a job he's doing this president  and i'm the one that signed it  i said  could you put it into effect but statutorily  it has to mature  mature  mature  so the earliest i could get is january 1st  it's like crazy  you know another one  i'll give you another one  i'll give you another one  so air force one  so that's the 757  but they have a 747  which is the big air force one  i think that just disrespected the people of minnesota today  they gave us the little one  no  actually it's because of the runway  in fact  when we landed  they said  ""sir  we have a very short runway  could you please hold on  i said  ""i trust these pilots "" by the way  these pilots are the best pilots  when you fly the president of the united states  wait a minute  he's waving from the window  when you fly the president of the united states  you are the best flyer  they take the best air force guys  they take the best marines in the helicopters  marine one  but when you're flying these planes  you can land that sucker  you have no problem  there's no  mishits  there's no  ""let's go around  i can't quite make it  sir "" these guys are phenomenal  you've got to see what they look like  everyone's in perfect shape  i look at him  central casting  every one of them they're great  thank you fellas  thank you  but i'll tell you a little story  so air force one is a very old plane  it's beautiful  but it's an old 747  right  it's 31 years old and other people didn't want to do it  but it was time to get a new one  it was time  you got to get a new plane  and actually air force one  i'll give you a little secret  it's actually two planes  they get two  it's a hell of a way to travel  if one's not working perfect  you use the other one  but they get two  so air force one  they negotiated a price and they had it down for  5 7 billion  that was not sounds expensive  and it's ridiculous  but that was done by the obama administration  it was done by the obama administration  and that's okay  but no administration obama  bush  they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury  but at some point you got to buy a plane for the country  and these arab countries would have their beautiful 747  800s  900s pour in  and they were gorgeous  and believe it or not  the new plane is a much bigger plane  much bigger wingspan  it's a much more beautiful plane  it's modern  i think of a 31 years old  air force one is 31 years old  the main air force one  not this  this is a great plane  but the big one 31 years old  so you're representing the country  but they didn't want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes  in all fairness  now it's very technical  there's a lot of stuff  i won't talk about it because i don't want to give away any classified information  just trust me  some more sophisticated sucker you've ever seen in your life  i think you're getting into a plane that cost 5 7 billion  right  but it's the most sophisticated  two planes  so i said  ""how much is it  a general came  and an air force general  great guy  handsome guy  they're all so good looking these people  i said  ""so general  what are we paying  what's the price "" "" sir  it's  5 7 million and we're ready to go  sir  could you sign it "" it sounds like a lot of money to me  general  5 7 million for two airplanes  can we get a better price "" ""no  sir  this was negotiated by the obama administration  the obama administration  this was negotiated  sir  by barack hussein obama "" and i said  ""oh  that's good  it sounds very high  so here's what i'm going to do  tell boeing we're not taking the plane  we have no interest in  it's too much "" this is what i did  by the way  this is one of many stories  isn't this better than going and saying  ""i saved your iron range "" and i say  ""but please remember i did this too "" and i can do away with this stuff  but i did this too  please remember that because i have all this list of incredible things i've done for minnesota  i won't even touch it because frankly i'm tired of repeating what i've done for all these different states  i mean  i did all this stuff and then i hear i'm nine down  i don't believe it by the way  suppression  so i said to the general  i said  ""general  5 7 billion  not million  billion  that sounds very high to me general  i bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters  i know a lot about it  how could it be five "" ""sir  that's the best price they could get  we only have one day to do it "" i said  ""cancel it general  cancel the order "" it was signed actually  ""yes  sir "" i said  ""do you have the right to cancel it "" ""yes  sir  i do "" we negotiated a great deal  i said  ""oh good  cancel it "" ""yes  sir  i'm pleased to tell you something  sir  we have a breakup fee  we made a great deal  sir "" i said  ""you did  oh  you have a breakup fee  you mean you can't just cancel it for nothing  then cancel it  you don't have to pay a breakup fee  i know about breakup fees "" ""no  sir  we have a breakup fee "" ""okay  how much is it "" ""sir  we can break it up for  250 million "" i said  ""wait a minute  so you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs  250 million "" in other words  we give them  250 million  we get nothing  i said  ""general  don't cancel the order  just tell him i'm very unhappy "" this is what these guys  they're good businessmen  by the way  these guys  right here  mike  they might be better than you  i don't even know  he may be the next governor  mike landell  maybe you should run  you should run  he is my complete and total investment  you should run  he'd be a hell of a governor  at least  you know one thing  minnesota would be well promoted  mike  run for governor  please  so he says  ""it's  250 million  it's 250  sir  i'm so proud of that "" i said  ""you may be proud  but i'm not "" so i said  ""general  don't give them notice because i don't want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing  i don't think i could explain that to the american public  so tell them you're really unhappy  we're not going to make the deal  but just do it verbally "" and  ""yes  sir "" and then i spoke to the head of boeing  a very nice guy  they had some rough times since then  they had a couple of really bad things happen  terrible  really terrible  this was early on before the problems that they had  but he is  he's a high quality guy  and i said to him  ""dennis  we have to start it with a窶ｦ it's got to have a three on the front of it "" what do i know  i just know that if they're 5 7  and if i do something with a three  he said  ""no  i can bring it down to 5 5 billion "" so i say  ""well  that's not bad  i save  200 million in about a minute and a half phone call  so so far i'm not good  but it's not good enough  i'm not happy "" i said  ""no  we got to really think about canceling it "" and i can't go to airbus  which is made in europe  it's a little hard  i got to go to their competitor  i can't say i'm going to buy the air force one from a european company that doesn't work too well  my only option was to say  ""look  i just don't want to just put it aside "" he calls me up a few days later  ""well  we can do a little bit better than that "" i said  ""dennis  has to have a three in front of it  dennis "" got to have a three  like a three  three anything  but got to have a three in front of it  so he said  ""no  no  no "" after one month  we signed a contract for  3 9 billion  same exact one  actually slightly better  we got an extra generator  and then boeing came to me  and i love to negotiate  i do  got that from my father  my father was a good negotiator and i love to negotiate  so they came to me  ""sir  we can put an extra stairway "" this is the big 747  and remember this is a big  much bigger than the old 747  ""sir  it gets very windy up there  i noticed that your hair's blown all over the place  but we can buy a stairwell for the plane  and it comes under  it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane "" you're very high off the ground  big  big thing  ""and it opens up  and if it's raining or windy  you're covered  sir  because it's under the plane  you're totally sheltered "" i said  ""that sounds great  so it's a corkscrew stairwell "" i said  ""how much is that general "" ""50 "" i said  ""50  what a deal  so for  50 000 i can get a stairway "" ""no  sir   50 million "" i said  ""forget about the stairwell  forget it "" he said 50  i really thought he meant  50 000  so these are just some little stories  i guess i must like minnesota to go on one of these deals  but boy  did you get your money's worth tonight  is anybody having a bad time  did you get your money's worth  because you've heard the other one  we've done this  and we've cut your taxes  and we built up the military bigger and better  and we're the number one in history in regulation cuts  which is the biggest thing  and the judges  which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done  everything we've done  nobody has done more in three and a half years  no administration three and a half  those first three and a half years  nobody even comes close  and you know  it's a funny thing  i say it all the time  i've been saying it for a long time and the fake news  nobody even questions me about it  and you know if i was wrong  they would  but they can't question me because when you see right to try  we took care of our vets  we just got a 91% approval rating from the vets 91  it's never happened before  we got choice approved  we got accountability approved  drugs are way down  we've got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs  a lot of everything  but drugs were way down  we had our best year in the history of our country last year  and we're going to have a better year coming up  that's why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there  and remember this  and i really appreciate this  thank you  but i appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the iron range have endorsed me over sleepy joe  what do you like better  sleepy joe or slow joe  what's better  let's do a poll  we do a poll  we do a poll  i do free falls  you know  these polls  they charge you a fortune for this stuff  they interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars  we interviewed 233 people  i got thousands of people at least for free  what do you like better as nickname  slow joe or sleepy joe  so let's go  wait  slow joe first  okay  so just scream if you like it  so you have a choice  slow joe  they're both very appropriate  slow joe or sleepy joe  ready  slow joe  i think we're going to have a winner here  sleepy joe based steel  real crap  it wasn't that  but when you think of it  they wrote it out  you didn't have environmentally the right  somebody said  ""oh  well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries "" it wasn't that  i opened it up  i signed an order  i signed an executive order because obama took your iron range and biden took your iron range away  and i'll never forget  the day i did it  and tom was there  a man  i don't know who he is  he's probably in this massive audience  but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life  including at childbirth  he didn't cry at childbirth  but he was crying  and he said  ""sir  you gave our life back to us because obama took our heart out when he closed up the iron range "" he said you gave our heart back  it's true  so i just want to thank those cities  when a democrat mayor  and we have now a lot of窶ｦ now we have additional  so these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us  and it's a great thing  we're finding that all over the country  democrats for trump  politicians that got elected as democrats  i don't think they changed their party affiliation  but they endorsed trump  they're all in the iron range area  and larry cuffe is here  larry cuffe  where's larry  where is he  larry  how are you  why did you do that  larry  that's so nice  i appreciate it  boy  are you good  i wish you had a mic  he said  ""because you're the best candidate we could ever窶ｦ"" i love this guy  said you're the best candidate we could ever hope for  thank you larry  that's beautiful  i appreciate it  we'll do a good job  we're not going to let you down  and they're doing a good job over there  so dig in  dig in  dig we must  right  it's all going because of me  that's cool  man  thank you  no  he signed an executive order shutting it down  just shutting it down  and i hear it's got the best iron ore anywhere in the world  that's what i hear  the quality is the best  窶ｦ or anywhere in the world  that's what i hear  the quality is the best  and it's like an unlimited amount  i'm talking about a little  this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else  and for me  it was very easy  andrea zupancich  where is she  where's andrea  thank you very much  that's really nice  i'm glad that at least you got a good location  right  that's great  i appreciate it very much  you're all friends i guess  chris vreeland  where's chris  chris vreeland  chris  where's chris  the mayor  thank you  chris  thank you  chris  thank you very much  kathy brandau  kathy brandau  thank you  kathy  i hope you're having a good time tonight  we're not going to let you down  you know that  we're open  that sucker is open  we're not closing it  well  think of this though  if biden gets in  it's closed  he said he's going to close it  how about this guy  no fracking  you're not going to frack  onstage with all these crazy people and they don't want any energy  they think everything's going to run by wind  which costs you a fortune  about 20 times more than what we have and doesn't work  but think of it  all of these people窶ｦ and they say  ""what about fracking  fracking is the modern technology  and so they all said  ""no  no  we're all against窶ｦ everyone's against fracking  what about you "" yes  i'm against it too  now he's against it for months  he gets it  now he's in favor of it  but he's sort of grandfathering it  you know  it's a very weak窶ｦ well  i like to grandfather fracking  if i'm a fracker  i don't want to be grandfather  i want to have it or not have it  right  he wants to grandfather fracking  always go with their first statement  okay  so i was in texas two weeks ago  we had crowds  mike  we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well  to the drilling well  where we went to see a well  and we saved the industry because i got russia and saudi arabia to cut back 10 million barrels  it actually was probably 18  ended up being  i think  18 5 million barrels  and it saved the industry  and yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump  but we saved 10 million jobs  but i'm in texas  and let me tell you  texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic  there was no demand  there was nobody driving  there was no demand  nobody ever saw anything like it  so i'm in texas and i said to the crowd  it was a great crowd  and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road  on the highways and roadways waving  and they had the most beautiful trump flags  i wanted to stop  ""where did you buy that flag "" the most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president  is mike pence doing a good job by the way  he did such a great窶ｦ he worked 29 hours a day  i mean  this guy works day and night  he worked not the 24  he worked 24 plus least five  okay  this man is a worker and he's a wonderful human being  and when they try it  a guy like biden that can't carry his jockstrap  when biden goes  ""oh  they should have closed one week earlier""  and here's the guy that said i made a mistake when i banned china that nothing's going to happen  it's so phony  this politics is a very phony business  i haven't been doing it long  i told one of the senators that came in  he came into my office there  "" i've been doing this for 30 years  i've won many elections  i've only lost twice in my life  i've been a senator for a long time  i know what i'm doing  sir""  i said  ""yeah  and i've done it for four years  and i've only won one election  but it's for the president of the united states "" i remember a certain man on television that didn't like me too much  he said  ""they put together the greatest field ever assembled  the republicans  remember  17 plus me  they put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled  i hear trump wants to come in  he's not going to do it number one  number two  if he does  he's just doing it for fun and he'll be out by september and then he'll go about leading his life  but he's not going to do it  but we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party "" the greatest talent he's ever seen  and then i did it and just week after week  one out  two out  three out  four out  and then we've done changes  oh  he said  ""he can't do it because he doesn't have any experience "" but i actually do on the other side  i contributed to politics  i always found it very interesting  so in a certain way  i had a lot of experience probably  maybe i had too much experience  that's why i can tell you about aoc  check out the  2 million please  check it out  check it out  check out omar  check out omar  get to that great writer  he should get窶ｦ oh  so the new york times won all these pulitzer prizes  right  i was going to tell you before  all these pulitzer prizes  these people  and they all got it wrong  right  they got for russia  russia  russia  we give the pulitzer prize  i won't use names  i won't use names  but we give the pulitzer prize to the new york times  they got it wrong  we give the pulitzer prize to the washington post and all of these real sleazebags  i have to be honest with you  very dishonest people  very dishonest  i call it the amazon washington post  he uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the washington post  he gets crap that other people wouldn't get  okay  that means it's a lobby  it's a lobbyist deal  but they got the prize  right  they got the pulitzer prize  all the guys that got it right  that really got it right  they all got it wrong  totally wrong  and they should return the pulitzer prize  and pulitzer association  the committee should ask for those prizes back  they got it all wrong  they were a hundred percent wrong  there was no collusion  they couldn't believe  remember the day when it was announced after three years  there is no collusion  i could have told them that a day one  they could have saved 48 million dollars  they got the pulitzer  and then you take guys so many  so many  solomon  sara carter  bongino  how about dan bongino  so many  so talented guys  how about that great gentlemen who wrote the witch hunt  remember that  that was the first  right  you know what i'm talking about  he's fantastic  all great  these people should have won the pulitzer prize  now i would say sean hannity and lou dobbs and laura and tucker  in all fairness  tucker was very good  tucker was great  but these are all people that got it right  now they don't do i guess the pulitzer prize for that stuff  but they probably should  but these guys all got it right  and all they did was get a lot of money because they're very successful  and that's okay i guess  but they should give the pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers  many of whom are back there right now  all of those writers  they should do that  and a candidate for congress  michelle fischbach  who's supposed to be fantastic  and michelle has my complete and total endorsement  but jason  you're in good shape  wow  you're in better shape than these congressman jase  by the way  jason is fantastic and he's doing a fantastic窶ｦ where's michelle  is she there  be careful  it's not worth the broken legs  look at her  oh  she's a warrior  i can tell  come on up  but thanks  michelle  and they have my complete endorsement  they're great people  they love your state  they love our country  so just in conclusion  i want to say that over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world  and we will end our reliance on china once and for all  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  and you probably heard me today  it used to be puerto rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies  and then what happened  they made a lot  they did a good job  and obama biden destroyed it  they took away the incentive  all of the taxes  and they took away the incentive and puerto rico went down a long way  we'll get some of that back to puerto rico and we'll get it back for us  take it away from china  you heard that  yes  they took it away  and then people automatically vote  it's like a habit  will i vote for the democrat  the democrat was so bad to you  and how bad were the democrats to israel  we did jerusalem  right  we broke up the iran deal  right  and then they vote for a democrat  it's out of habit  but i think the habits  we're breaking those habits very quickly  but we've helped puerto rico and we've really helped窶ｦ if you look at what we've done for israel  it's been incredible  they say nobody's done more  and it's my honor  but we'll hire more police  increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement  and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities  which are a disaster  we'll appoint tough on crime prosecutors  we will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written  we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  and that's why the supreme court is so important  the next president will get one  two  three  or four supreme court justices  i had two  many presidents have had none  they've had none because they're there for a long time  they tend to be appointed young  they're there for a long time  but the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four  think of that  that will totally change when you talk about life  when you talk about second amendment  when you talk about things that are so important to you  you're going to be stuck for 40 years  35 years  a long time  so this is going to be the most important election  in my opinion  in the history of our country  you got to get it right  because if you don't get it right  we will not have a country anymore  you're not going to have a country  not as we know it  you won't have a country anymore  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech  and the right to keep and bear arms  we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of these ridiculous  horrible  endless foreign wars  countries you've never heard of  coming home  we will maintain america's unrivaled military mind  and we will ensure peace through strength  this is what we have now  peace through strength  remember what i told you about those weapons  we don't want to use ever  we don't want to use those weapons  we will end surprise medical billing  require price transparency  january 1st  he doesn't even have to do anything now  i'll be so angry if he窶ｦ they'll say  ""what a job he's done on transparency  can you believe it "" and he won't even know what transparency is  and it's complex  and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs  we've done that already  we will strongly protect medicare and social security  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  and we brought nasa back  nasa  when i got in three and a half years ago  grass was growing through the cracks of the runway  it was over  it was closed  it was nothing  now it's the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools  we will  we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto  in god we trust  you know that the democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus  two of them  not one  i heard the first one  i said  ""oh  they must've made a mistake "" they left under god out of the pledge of allegiance  yeah  yeah  yeah  now they then said  ""oh  well we didn't mean that "" they meant it  that's what they're going to do  they're going to take god out of it  just like i was saying before  texas  they don't want god  they don't want oil  they don't want guns  i don't think they're going to do too well in texas  do you agree with that  i don't think they're going to do too well in minnesota either  no  but could you imagine you're campaigning  and it doesn't play too well here  but could you imagine you're in texas and you have a guy say  ""no oil  no god  no guns  oh  i think i'm going to vote for joe biden  everybody "" and then they say  ""texas is in play  it's a very close窶ｦ"" i have a friend in texas  he said  ""i think you're winning by 15 points "" these people are crazy  texas is in play  they don't want to let you have oil  think of it  it's unbelievable  texas is in play  that's the fake news back there  they said it last time too  remember  texas  when they say in play  that means it's too close to call  it's in play  too close  we've heard that for a long time  in play  right  too close to call  and they said it four years ago  ""texas is in play  this could be a terrible defeat  losing texas  big state  great state  this would be a tremendous defeat "" and they said it about ohio too  i think we won by like nine points  right  they said ohio is in play  utah's in play  we won by a lot  remember we beat a guy named mcmuffin  remember the guy  he was going to take the state of utah  and then he was going to be able to negotiate  but that didn't work out  he came in third  even hillary beat him  but they said texas is in play  and i'd go around telling my people  ""damn it  texas is in play  how the hell  every time i go there  i have 35 000 people at the stadium  how could it possibly be in play "" they said it's in play  my people would say  ""i don't think so "" and we had a big texas rancher  he was on one of the shows  he was wearing a big  beautiful hat  i wish i could wear those hots  it wouldn't work for me too well  i don't think it works for me  right  but it worked for him  and he said  ""i don't know too much about a lot  but i know one thing  texas is not in play  and this guy is going to win texas by a hell of a lot of votes "" and that's what happened that night  the night of the election  the night of the election  they called the results  i've been listening for six months  ""texas is so close  we can't even imagine it it's so close  this is big "" and they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide  it's got to be tremendous  and they said  ""texas has closed its doors  ladies and gentlemen  donald trump has won the state of texas "" they didn't even say the polls were closed  they forgot to say the polls were closed  i wanted to say  i said  ""how come i won "" i called my people  ""how could i have won  it was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed "" and i heard from the governor of texas  great guy  greg abbott  i said  ""how are we doing compared to four years ago "" we did great four years ago  big  big win  he said  ""sir  you're doing much better "" but these guys keep saying it's in play  it's the same way that i'm down nine points in minnesota  if i lose minnesota  if i lose minnesota  jason  i'm going to blame jason if i lose  boy  we almost had it last time  but we did the right thing  we went to michigan  we won michigan  first time in many  many years  that michigan was won  it's a great state  for years you had a president who apologized for america  and now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for minnesota  so get your friends  get your family  get your neighbors  get your coworkers  and get out and vote  and you know it's starting today in minnesota  that's why i'm here  it started today  go out of here  you know what  if they're closed  what the hell time is it now  if they're closed  just stand in line like you do  people were here two days ago trying to get in here  it's crazy  so do the same thing at the voting booth  please  from st  paul to st  cloud  from rochester to duluth  and from minneapolis  thank god we still have minneapolis  to right here  right here with all of you great people  this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families  they were tough and they were strong  you have good genes  you know that  right  you have good genes  a lot of it's about the genes  isn't it  don't you believe  the resource theory you think was so different  you have good genes in minnesota  they didn't have a lot of money  they didn't have a lot of luxury  but they had grit  they had faith  and they had each other  that's what you have now  you have each other  they were miners and lumberjacks  fishermen and farmers  shipbuilders and shopkeepers  but they all had one thing in common  they loved their families  they loved their countries  and they loved their god  proud citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we're going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  and don't forget  you went through years where you weren't winning  right  years and years  they closed down  even with obama  he closed that iron  i think he just wanted to get even with you  i don't know  he wasn't good  not a good窶ｦ we've knocked out about 84% of the things he did  then you say  ""i wonder if he likes me "" but you're getting used to winning and you're going to see winning like you've never seen before  you had your best year and you're going to win so much  you've heard this  right  i haven't said it in a long time because we've been doing a lot of winning  but you're going to win so much  and you're going to send jason to the us senate  and you're going to keep winning and winning and winning  you're going to win on trade  you're going to win on the military  you're going to win on everything you touch  minnesota is going to keep on winning and you're going to get tired of winning because minnesota doesn't want to win all the time  your football team is going to

years since the election  but we go before the election  working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy  but with your help  we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months  let's watch  let's just watch  very dishonest people  now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus  you know that right  coronavirus  they're politicizing it  we did one of the great jobs  you say  ""how's president trump doing "" they go  ""oh  not good  not good "" they have no clue  they don't have any clue  they can't even count their votes in iowa  they can't even count  no  they can't  they can't count their votes  one of my people came up to me and said  ""mr  president  they tried to beat you on russia  russia  russia "" that didn't work out too well  they couldn't do it  they tried the impeachment hoax  that was on a perfect conversation  they tried anything  they tried it over and over  they'd been doing it since you got in  it's all turning  they lost  it's all turning  think of it  think of it  and this is their new hoax  but we did something that's been pretty amazing  we have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early  we went early  we could have had a lot more than that  we're doing great  our country is doing so great  we are so unified  we are so unified  the republican party has never ever been unified like it is now  there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now  never been a movement  so a statistic that we want to talk about  go ahead  say usa  it's okay  usa  so a number that nobody heard of  that i heard of recently and i was shocked to hear it  35 000 people on average die each year from the flu  did anyone know that  35 000  that's a lot of people  it could go to 100 000  it could be 27 000  they say usually a minimum of 27  goes up to 100 000 people a year die  and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the united states  nobody  and it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared  it doesn't mean we won't  but think of it  you hear 35 and 40 000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode  cnn fake news and the camera just went off  the camera  the camera just went off  turn it back on  hey  by the way  hold it  look at this  and honestly  all events are like this  it's about us  it's all about us  i wish they'd take the camera  show the arena please  they never do  they never do  they never do it  they never show the arena  you can hear it because when you hear it  that's not 200 people  that's not a hundred people  that's thousands and thousands of people including people outside  you can hear it  they always show my face  see that face  they show my face  i want them to show the arena  not my face  right  how many have you been to  how many rallies have you gone  practically every one  can you believe it  i'm sure your husbands are thrilled  right  they're thrilled  where are you going tonight  i'm going to another trump rally  cool  number 114  what do your husbands say about that  this group up here  she said  ""we don't care "" thank you  thank you  democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job  we're doing a great job with what we have to work with  it's incredible  the democrats want us to fail so badly  even if their actions  and you take a look  hurt the people of this country  they'll hurt the people themselves  their wealth  their everything  they're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad  even if they know it's not so  we made an unbelievable deal with mexico  with canada  with china  with south korea  with japan  and if you put a microphone with these people back there like the academy awards used to be  not anymore  best movie of the year  it's made in south korea  what's that all about  i'm waiting to see the best movie of the year- and it's made窶ｦ he said  ""it's garbage "" only in south carolina can you say that  only in south carolina  you're going to get us in trouble  no  i'm just repeating what he said for the fake news  no  but seriously the academy awards has gone way  way down in ratings  do you know why  because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore  that's why  no  but they had the best movie of the year made in south korea  they make enough stuff for us  right  and they're good  they're our friends  take advantage of us  that's okay  not so much anymore  we are really  you take a look  magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world  we're prepared for the absolute worst  you have to be prepared for the worst  but hopefully it will all amount to very little  that's why i tell you when we have the flu with 35 000 people and this one we have to take it very  very seriously  that's what we're doing  we are preparing for the worst  my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the united states  we are ready  we are ready  totally ready  on january 31st  i ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in china from entering the united states  an action which the democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying  ""thank you very much  you were 100% correct "" could've been a whole different story  but i say  so let's get this right  a virus starts in china  bleeds its way into various countries all around the world  doesn't spread widely at all in the united states because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes  and the democrats' single talking point  and you see it  is that it's donald trump's fault  right  it's donald trump's fault  no  just things that happened  but you know what this does show you  things happen  whoever thought of this two weeks ago  who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago  you wouldn't  but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it  and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world  the best in the world and we are so ready  at the same time that i initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years  we had a quarantine some people  they weren't happy  they weren't happy about it  i want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy  but after two weeks they got happy  you know who got happy  the people around them got happy  that's who got happy  i also created a white house virus task force  it's a big thing  a virus task force  i requested 2 5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need  the democrats said  ""that's terrible  he's doing the wrong thing  he needs eight and a half billion  not two and a half "" i've never had that before  i ask for two and a half  they want to give me eight and a half  so i said  ""i'll take it "" does that make me a bad窶ｦ i'll take it  i'll take it  i never had that before  i never had it  we want two and a half million  that's plenty  we demand you take eight and a half  he doesn't know what he's doing  we want eight and a half  these people are crazy  we must understand that border security is also health security  and you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic  it's gone up like magic  you think that was an easy one  that was not an easy one  it's going up great and we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security  water  everything  this is everything they wanted  132 miles already  we'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime  one of the reasons the numbers are so good  we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country  we have no choice  whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats  the democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all americans  now you see it with the coronavirus  you see it  you see it with the coronavirus  you see that  when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in  it's not the only thing that comes in through the border  and we're setting records now at the border  we're setting records  and now just using this  so important  right  so important  i'm doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the united states  we've got phenomenal numbers  no  it's true  the worst presidential harassment in history  we had a great event yesterday  an event that was so beautiful  young african american leaders  one of the things i asked them  and i've been thinking about this for a long time窶ｦ and great people  great people  some of them are here tonight  do you like the name african american or black  and they said  ""black "" all at the same time  no  true  i tell you  because you say  ""african american or black "" and they said almost immediately  ""black "" but we had an incredible group of people and what happened is nbc窶ｦ it was such a love fest  it was so incredible  it went on for 45 minutes  it was a love fest  it was incredible  nbc turned down窶ｦ there they are right there  they turned down窶ｦ comcast  which owns nbc窶ｦ actually nbc  i think  we call it msdnc  right  msdnc  but nbc i think is worse than cnn  i actually do  and comcast  a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image窶ｦ i'll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible  they are terrible  they're a terrible group of people  and they paid me a fortune for years for the apprentice  they paid me a fortune  and when i left the show  it was doing great  when i left the show  14 seasons  think of that  they got a big movie star  i won't tell you his name  nobody would know  actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time  but the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had trump  but the country in five years from now  of course you want to upset them  five years or nine years or 13 years  or 18 years  10 more years  nah  oh  they go crazy when you say it  when you say to them five more years  so it's five  but you then say maybe nine  maybe 13  maybe 17  maybe 21  or not  maybe 21  let's do this  let's term limit ourselves at 25 years  no more than 25 years  no more  okay  they'll pass something in the senate  tim  pass it in the senate with lindsey  a 25 year term limit please  07  while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with these vile hoaxes  we've been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  enacting fair trade deals  securing our border  and lifting up citizens of every race  religion  color  and creed  we added another 225 000 jobs last month alone  and that makes seven million jobs since our election  seven million  the unemployment rate in the great state of south carolina  you ever hear of that place  now sleepy joe would say  ""the unemployment rate in the great state of ohio窶ｦ"" no  no  you're in south carolina  joe  joe  you're in south carolina  come up  you ever see the guy with the note  ""no  no  it's south carolina  it's not ohio "" okay  then he goes  ""all right  iowa  did you say iowa "" no  no  they did that seven times  if i did that once  it would be the end of the road  right  be the end of the road  they'd say trump has lost it  they like to say that anyway  i guess though  these people are bad people  now  sleepy joe  well  he's running tomorrow  no  but could you imagine if i said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes  which are unbelievable  every speech  i actually said the other night  i was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns  i said  ""that's a horrible thing  that's the end of his evening  that's the end of his political career "" and then after the debate  they're revealing him and they said  ""joe biden had a great night last night "" i don't get it  tim  the unemployment rate here in south carolina has fallen to 2 3%  the lowest rate in your state's history  the lowest rate in all of america  it's the lowest rate in all of america  i said to a friend of mine  a democrat  ""how's the race going tomorrow  who's going to win "" and he says  ""mr  president窶ｦ"" no  it's very interesting  he said something  this guy's a real political pro too  in all fairness  even though he's a democrat  but i said  ""who's going to win "" he said  ""honestly  sir  it doesn't matter  you are so far ahead in south carolina that it's meaningless "" meaningless  that's what they say  and in north carolina too  in north carolina  bunch of losers  the good citizens of south carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the democrat candidates  whether it's this character that nobody ever heard of him  i'd never heard it  i thought i knew all the wealthy people  this guy tom  mr  impeachment  how did that work out  tom hey  he spent millions and millions of dollars in iowa  right  millions  he got less than 1%  he got one third of 1%  i wrote a little note  did you see it  it said  ""tom  it's not so easy doing what i did  is it "" not so easy  not so easy  all you have to do is ask mini mike  he's in there for a fortune  he wished he never started  mini mike  he wished he never started  he said  ""well  trump can do it  i'm going to do it too "" unfortunately it's not working out too well  was that the worst debate performance in history  they had a big audience  everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we're supposed to be doing up here  he turned out to be a total catastrophe  35 million people  can you believe that  that's a big audience  very big  and what a killer  but this guy steyer  he spends all this money  he's not that wealthy  he spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow  i have to be honest  by the way  are the republicans allowed to vote anyway even though窶ｦ are you ready  you ready  let's do it together  i assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint  i assume  lindsey  tim  our great congressmen  are we allowed to do this  so am i allowed to request窶ｦ first we- congressman  are we allowed to do this  am i allowed to request 窶ｦ first  we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against president trump  and then if it's legal  i always say if it's permissible by law  because they have so many little booby traps  but they only like getting the republicans  democrats skirt  right  but we'll see what happens about that  the democrats  but let me ask you this  lindsey  tim  you're pros  these are two of the greatest guys i know  so let me ask you this  so i don't know what the record attendance is in this arena  but i was told that we broke it by a lot  and you got the people outside  are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for  because you're allowed to skip  all right  so wait a minute  let's do a poll  we do this for the fake news back there  ready  who would be the best candidate for us  not for them  we're ready  ready  so let's go through them just quickly  we won't include steyer because he's a loser  he's out  okay  we won't include him  who would be the best  this is a real poll  this isn't one of those fake polls taken by 窶ｦ in all fairness  i love you  fox  taken by fox  the worst pollster  this guy 窶ｦ this pollster hates trump's guts  i was losing the last election by a fortune  they said  ""he did great with women "" everything was wrong  and they never replaced this guy  but watch this  you ready  so first we'll go 窶ｦ let's say sleepy joe  right  right  then we'll go crazy bernie  then we'll go mini mike  i think he's out of it  should we include mini mike or not  mini mike is gone  mini mike is gone  i think he's gone  he doesn't have a chance  so let's not talk 窶ｦ and he's not in your election anyways  so let's forget  so mini mike  i hear mini mike  by the way  has left  he's basically given up  that's what i hear  he gave up  he gave up  now  i hope what i just said keeps him in  you know  he's the kind of a guy  he'll stay in because  ""i don't want to be wrong "" mike  it's time to go home  go home  mike  and enjoy your life  go home and spend some money on something horrible to people  they said  ""she's not dumb  but she's just damn mean  we can't vote for her "" she's a mean one  she is mean  so pocahontas  should we leave her in or out  how about klobuchar  not going to happen  so really we're down to two candidates  right  sleepy joe biden and crazy bernie  so this is a poll  i guarantee you this  as much as they hate me  they hate me  they're going to put this all over the place  we have a poll of like 30 000 people inside and out  they're doing it outside  too  we have a poll  are you ready  who do i 窶ｦ so in other words  who's the weaker of the two  i'm not interested in who does better  no  no  i'm not interested 窶ｦ wait  ready  in other words  who do i want to run against  meaning 窶ｦ very simple  we put it into nice  simple language  who the hell is easier to beat  so who is easier for us  not me  for us to beat  ready  crazy bernie  or sleepy joe  i don't know  i think maybe a crazy bernie has it a little bit  once more just quick  ready  he said  ""it doesn't matter  you'll beat them all "" i hope so  i hope so  so who is easier to beat  crazy bernie or sleepy joe  they think bernie's easier to beat  they think bernie's easier to beat  so whether it's bernie sanders' plan to eliminate private healthcare  elizabeth warren's plan  i told you that i had more indian blood in me than her  even though i have none  i have none  zero  i have none  i have none  i said i have more indian blood in me than she has  and she choked  she said  ""i'm going to show  i'm going to show "" she hired this company and they went out and did a blood test  1 024th  right  so that means i probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago  i'm telling you  that was horrible  she choked  we don't want a person to win that chokes  we don't want to choke artist  right  one thing you will say about me  i'm not a choker  with all these people for years  they're after me years  we can't have chokers  we can't have chokers as your president  so elizabeth warren's plan to eliminate america's borders  that's what she would 窶ｦ or mini mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment and take away your guns  how about that  mini mike wants to take away your guns  the insanity of the democrat party is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement  they are joining our great new republican party  this november  we are going to take back the house  we are going to hold the senate  and we are going to keep the white house  i wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people  seriously  i wonder what they say  they never talk about it  they'll say  ""joe biden had a fabulous crowd today "" fabulous  so fabulous that there's like five people  and they'll leave and they'll say  ""president trump had a smattering of applause "" smattering  they use the word smattering a lot  this is not 窶ｦ let's let them hear it  this is not a 窶ｦ this is a big 窶ｦ this is not a smattering  it's not a smattering  turn the cameras  that's not a smattering  that is not a smattering  i hate it  they say donald trump 窶ｦ in india  i hate to say this to you  but 窶ｦ so they actually have 129 000 seat stadium  did you see it  the place was packed  and they did better than most  they gave me credit for 100 000  that was not bad  it's 129  the stadium holds 100  they had a field that's about three times 窶ｦ it's cricket  it's the biggest stadium  and they had 129  i was with the prime minister of india  modi  great guy  loved by the people of india  and we had an amazing thing  and i went in  and here's the problem  this is a big crowd  and normally i like talking about my crowds because i get the crowds like nobody  but i just got back from 140 or 50 or 60 000 people and now i'm coming here  what does this place hold  15  it's hard to be enthused  you understand that  i may never be excited again about a crowd after going to india  think of this  they have 1 5 billion people  we have 350  so we're doing pretty well  i'll tell you what  but i love this crowd  and i love that crowd too  tell you they have a great love for 窶ｦ they have a great love  they have a great leader  and they have a great love for the people of this country  that was really a worthwhile trip  with us tonight are both of your incredible us senators  two incredible friends  two warriors  senator lindsey graham and senator tim scott  come up here  and by the way  tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row  as they're doing that  they got this big 窶ｦ i was going to almost do a poll on the two of them  but we're not doing that  but lindsey is a true fighter for south carolina  loves your state  and as chairman of the senate judiciary committee 窶ｦ you know that  right  he's the chairman of the senate judiciary committee  so important  so important  senator graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the constitution as written  lindsey was amazing  you remember  for justice brett kavanaugh  remember how badly he 窶ｦ great job  lindsey  great job  man  thank you  senator scott is a leading superstar  he's a superstar  but he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it  people don't know  but in the last year  prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years  and that was with no democrat help  if we had the help  we could lower it by 50%  but we'll get their help  one of these days  they're going to get smart  senator scott provides world class care for our veterans  what he's done for our veterans is incredible  and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones  including 135 right here in south carolina  that's what it is  tim scott came to my office with an idea  he said  ""opportunity zone "" i said  ""tim  what the hell is that "" what is it  right  tim  and he went through a whole big thing and i said  ""this maybe could work "" and we tried it  it is an incredible success  and what he's done for this country is incredible  it's incredible  lindsey  we'll start with lindsey  say a few words  please  thank you  well  that was quite a display  wasn't it  now there's a lot of love in this room  a lot of people say to me  friends of mine  they've very successful  they'll say  ""how do you speak in front of 25 000 people and 10 000 people and all of this "" you know why  there's such love in the room it's easy  no  it's true  there is such 窶ｦ i explained  they don't understand it  because they're not for doing that  but i say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it's easy to do  very easy  right  it's sort of easy to do  we're also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state  and some of you maybe know i liked this guy for a long time  governor henry mcmaster  come up  henry  come up  henry  representatives joe wilson  jeff duncan  william timmons  ralph norman  tom rice  and the chairman of the south carolina republican party  drew mckissick  as i introduce somebody  and i'll just say stay there because he was brave  but he got hit hard  he's a very special man  retired marine corps  major general  and most of you know he received the congressional medal of honor  james e  livingston  james  just relax  where's james  he got hit hard  thank you  james  congressional medal of honor winner  thank you  james  they are great brave people  you know  we have the congressional medal of honor and we have the presidential medal of freedom  and they're both the highest awards  one civilian  one is military  i always say getting the presidential medal of freedom is much less painful because when i read them off  i'll read like with james or with so many of the congressional medal of honors  many are not living  to be honest with you  and i'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill  hit 19 times by gunfire  grabbing four people  bringing them down  getting onto a helicopter  falling out of the helicopter  hitting a tree on the way down  hitting a tree  they went back and saved him  but he died later  i mean  those are tough deals  those are tough deals  we have one right here who's living  we have one right here who's living  but they are tough  so thank you very much for being here  and maybe i could ask our governor  our great governor of this incredible state  to say a few words  please  henry  thank you very much  and where's alan  is your son here  you're great son  attorney general  alan  thank you very much  take good care of him  okay  thank you  thank you  alan  and thanks to republicans all over america  we are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible  since my election  over 121 000 new jobs have been created right here in south carolina  we've lifted 10 million people off welfare  including 7 million off of food stamps  and that's a good thing  not a bad thing  they're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing  we make money  they pay taxes  it's a whole different deal  median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country  the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years  the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history  how about that one  it's a good one  that's a good one  the unemployment rate among african-americans  hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows  black youth unemployment has reached an all time low  black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country   paid family leave  reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of  2 200 more in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit  republican  not democrat  we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country  for years  politicians sold you out to global special interests  enriching other countries at your expense  that ended  that ended  but i am not the president of the globe  i don't want to be the president of the world  i am the president of the united states of america   reciprocal  reciprocal  got to be fair  after years of building up other countries  we are finally rebuilding our country  we are finally putting america first  on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration  every democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you  the american taxpayer  they want to treat illegal aliens  people that come into our country illegally  better than they want to treat our military and our veterans  not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury  but it threatens innocent lives  i recently invited to the white house the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped  beaten  brutalized  and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in new york city  here in charleston county  an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade  in berkeley county  officers captured a previously deported ms-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire  and he should have never been in our country  he shouldn't have been allowed  it's being built  it's being built  by the way  just in case you haven't heard  it is being built  that  you know  and they're going to go nuts  they're going to go nuts  they thought they got me  they said  ""okay "" have you heard them recently  ""okay  he's building the wall "" and you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when i have a whole party and a deep state and some never-trumpers  they're a dying breed though  the good thing  they're on respirator  they're on respirator  they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation  you can do it  i'm not doing it  they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation  the never-trumpers  but you think it's easy  it's not  but that's been built  but you know what they say now  ""okay  he's building the wall  but mexico's not paying for it "" yes they are  actually  they are  they are  they are paying for it  and some of the fake news knows that  but they refuse to report it  but that's okay  you'll see  you'll see what's going on  and i want to thank mexico because  by the way  right now they have 27 000 soldiers on our border protecting our border  we have mexico protecting our border  and they only do that for trump  they don't do that for sleepy joe  they don't do that for crazy bernie  and they don't do it for mini mike  that's for sure  they're only doing that for trump  right  27 000 soldiers protecting our border  in this region 窶ｦ 窶ｦ thousand soldiers protecting our border  in this region of the country alone last year  ice 窶ｦ they've been treated so badly  right  they are great  they're brave  they're tough  any men  there are tough guys in here  but anybody want to be an ice officer  it's tough stuff  right  they go into those nests  they call them nest  that's where these guys get together and they knock the hell  i mean  if they have to 窶ｦ i have to be very careful  i don't want to get them in trouble  because the press wants us to be very politically correct  so let me change it around  they go into a nest of ms13  and they say  ""oh  hello gentlemen  how are you "" on occasion  they have a fight  they never lose those fights  we need people like that  ""hello gentleman  how are you  how many people did you kill last year  how many people did you get kill last year with a knife "" because they like knives because it's more painful  this is the kind of people that we were letting into our country  ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands  by the thousands  last year  ice officers arrested 12 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses  including robbery  rape and many for a thing called murder  on wednesday we won the big case in federal court  did you see that  did you see that  we won the case unanimously  unanimously  federal appeals court  where we don't have to give money to sanctuary cities and states if they don't work with us  finally  finally  finally  why should we  yet the democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens  they want unfettered catch and release  we have ended that program  it was not easy  we have to go through courts  everything is a court  everything is a suit  we do anything  we turn to the right  they sue us  we turn to the left  they sue us  we win  but we're winning  we have 218 judges now  it's good  let me just preface that by saying i know they give fair opinions  it bears no relationship to who appoints them  but i never win with an obama appointed judge ever  i don't win  no  we have great judges going onto the courts  great judges  they're fair judges  they're judges that truly love our constitution  it's great  they're judges that if we feel it's right  they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders  very simple  the democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens  you know that  you've been reading  all you have to do is pick up a paper every day  they release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities  we don't do that anymore  we won't let it happen  and now we don't have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they're going to want  it's a whole game changer   ""i don't think he's doing a good job "" this guy doesn't know he's alive  oh  what bad people  republicans believe america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans  not for criminal aliens  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring  and we have ended catch and release permanently  you know what catching release is  we catch them  we grab them  we say  ""could we please have your address "" ""address  i don't know what the hell is an address "" they don't have an address  ""could we have a number  do you have a phone  could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court "" what they do is they catch him  they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives  and it's one of those things in many cases  and then release  we release him into our country  we don't do that anymore  if you knew what it took 窶ｦ we catch them  and we take some information and we release them in  and we say  ""please report back in four years from now for your trial "" about 2% come back  and they're the ones that are the dumbest people i've ever seen  2%  nobody comes back  it's crazy  but we're getting a change  it would be so easy  they call it loopholes  loopholes  that word alone  they call it loopholes  it would be so easy if we had some democrat support  we don't have any democrat support  they want open borders  they don't care about crime  border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year  we have deported record numbers of gang members  we are building the wall faster than ever  and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day  washington democrats have never been more extreme  132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' healthcare takeover  they want to take away your healthcare  while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security  that's what's going to happen  my administration is protecting your social security  your medicare  and is fighting to give you great healthcare  we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice  remember when president obama would say  ""you can keep your doctor  you could keep your plan "" 28 times  he said  ""you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan "" well  he lied  we should impeach him  we should impeach him for that  he lied 28 times  ""you'll keep your doctor  keep your plan  it's wonderful  great "" went through the roof  we're doing a great job  we killed the individual mandate  which is the most unbelievable  horrible  it's not really obamacare anymore  but we're running the hulk of it and we're trying to kill it entirely  and then we will put it back  you'll have great health care  and preexisting conditions will be totally protected  preexisting conditions will be totally protected  we're making healthcare better and much cheaper  while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office  we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old obamacare  think of that and better  and better  we are stopping surprise medical billing  a disgrace  i signed an executive order imposing price transparency  because when providers are required to show their prices  which they don't have to do  but now they do  those same prices fall very  very fast  we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs  which are just as good as the name brand drugs  but at a tiny fraction of the cost  they're just as good  i always like a name brand  i mean  there's something  there's no difference  probably sometimes they're better  we've totally transformed veteran's healthcare  getting long ought va choice and va accountability passed after 50 years   the spectacular right to try  you know what that is  if you're terminally ill  you go all over the world  if you have no money  you can't  you go home and you die  you're terminally ill  they go all over the world  if they have money  they go to asia  they go to europe  they're searching  we have the greatest doctors in the world  the greatest labs in the world  greatest technicians in the world  and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems  now  you sign a piece of paper  we're not going to hold anybody liable  you get to use that drug  and the results have been unbelievable  unbelievable  hopefully you don't need it  but now we have right to try  they've been trying for 51 years to get that approved  51 years  and we got it approved  i guess i'm good at getting things approved  aren't i  those people that i brought up here where the reason too  every one of them  they were incredible  thank you  thank you  senators  congressman  they were the reasons  we are combating the opioid epidemic  drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years  we have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease  which is a big deal  kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it's so much work  they die from overwork  it's just crazy  in theory  they could keep them going for a long time  but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do  we've done things that make it so much easier  and it's just such an honor to be involved  also  alzheimer's disease  we're really making strides  it's really a great thing  great thing  we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing  virtually every democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god  the democrat party is the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  blatant corruption  and the total obliteration of your second amendment  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and of course the late  great abraham lincoln  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background  every community  and every walk of life  we are the party of boundless optimism  excitement  energy and enthusiasm  we are a big tent  we are a big party  we are the party of big ideas for the future  this is where it is  this is where it is  this is not the old republican party  this is a very inclusive party  this is a great party  republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice  including right here in south carolina  we want to give school choice to every child in america who needs it  from kindergarten to 12th grade  because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school  i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life  that's a big deal  this could not have been done by anyone but the republican party  they came to me  a group of people  and they wanted criminal justice reform  i wasn't sure about the issue  but we had a lot of great republicans  very much in favor of it  including people that happen to be right here today  they were very much  and i started studying the issue  worked hard on the issue  and criminal justice reform  you saw alice johnson come out of prison  22 years  she had another 20 years left  think of it  for a phone call  for a phone call  a great woman  but we have many people coming out that shouldn't be there for anywhere near those terms  not for those terms  but they came to see me  a group  a group of people came  van jones  he came up  ""oh  thank you  sir "" they needed four senators  they needed help  i called lindsey  i called everybody  i called tim  who's so great on everything  i called everybody  they needed four senators and maybe five  and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction  i gave it to them  and i got it  and it was not easy  we get criminal justice reform  and then i signed it  then this van jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all  they say  ""van jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform "" i called our great first lady over  i said  ""darling  please take a look  it's going to be so nice  because honestly  look  they couldn't have done even close without me "" i got all these people together  got them done  it was impossible  previous presidents couldn't even think about it  they couldn't even think about doing it  and they tried  although i don't think they tried too hard  bur they could have never done it  so he gets up  and he starts by saying  ""i want to thank the reverend al sharpton  i knew al when he was very heavy  he looked better when he was heavy  it's true  he's one of the few people  he really looked better when he was heavy  he looked much better when he was heavy  i've got to tell him  i have to explain  because i know him very well  he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president  but he can't admit it on television "" but he called and he said  ""i want to take the reverend al sharpton "" and then name after name after name of people that i never heard of  my wife said  ""are they going to think about you  right  are they going to think about you "" i said  ""darling  of course "" i said  ""he's saving me til the end  because i was by far "" it's true  this is true  tim  lindsay  this is true  i said  ""he's saving me til the end  it's going to be such an honor to be recognized  because i don't get enough publicity  i need a little bit more "" he got to the end and he didn't say it  and she looked at me  she sort of smiled  i think she loved it in a certain way  but she sort of smiled  she said  ""that's too bad "" i said  ""yeah  it is "" then he said  ""i have one more thing to say  we must get out this year and fight and vote against this president of the united states "" can you believe that  it's true  it's a true story  van jones  these are just terrible that they could 窶ｦ i was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady  but i'll live through it somehow  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  52 years  52 years that golan heights had been fighting and fighting for it  i did it  and i did the true capital  jerusalem  right  how many presidents promise that  every president for many  many decades promised we're going to do that  they never did it  i did it  we did a lot  we've invested more than  2 trillion in the united states military  including more than  150 million this year in joint base charleston  fort jackson  and paris island  we created the sixth branch of the american armed forces  the space force  we have another branch  72 years  not for 72 years  the air force  have they done a new branch  we did the space force  when i first said it  everybody thought i was joking  i said  ""i'm not joking "" they thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies  i said  ""no  it's all about space "" in a number of years  people are going to say  ""i can't believe we didn't do this sooner "" we need a little vision  we need a little foresight  you know what  i mentioned space force  at arenas like this  it gets one of the biggest hands  because that's where it's at  that's where it's going  unfortunately  or fortunately  we needed it for defense  we needed it for offense  sixth branch  72 years  for years  we watched as your politicians apologize for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for the people of south carolina  at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation  i really believe that it's the survival  you see these maniacs that we're dealing with  they want to give away everything  we will end up being venezuela large scale version  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for  to secure  then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in november of 2020  november 3rd to be exact  only this way can we save the america we love and drain the swamp  i never thought it was this deep  man  i talked about a swamp  you never told me it was this bad  fellas  that swamp is bad  you got dirty cops at the top of the fbi  you got a lot of dirty people  but you also have phenomenal people in the fbi and other places  but we're draining that swamp  i never knew it was going to be this dirty  and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and from poverty to prosperity  that's what's happening  think of it  from poverty to prosperity  look at some of the stories that you have over there  look at some of the incredible stories  look at tim scott  look at that incredible story  no  really  it's an incredible story  lindsay will say it  i give about 99% of the credit to tim scott's mother  i do  i guarantee you  tim  there was no games  right  there was no games in your household  it was let's go to work  right  great mother  thank you very much  thank you  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system finally of immigration  we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase  ""made in the usa "" we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer  infectious diseases like we're working on right now  and ending the aids epidemic  nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years  and it should have been started before  we will end the aids epidemic  who would have thought we could have done that  we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on mars  you have to land on moon  and then you go to mars  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy  are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto  ""in god we trust "" from greenville to columbia and from myrtle beach to hilton head to right here in charleston  this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth  it's true  it's true  true  we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who have crossed the oceans  blazed the trails  settled the continent  tamed the wilderness  dug out the panama canal  lay down the railroads  revolutionized industry  liberated millions from poverty  hunger and disease  won two world wars  defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world  and we are making it greater every single day  proud citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people

""senator scott  senator lindsay graham  we're tired of winning and south carolina  can't do it anymore  it's too much  it's too much  we've had years where we weren't winning  and it was okay  we

"" i'll say  ""mr  senators  let me tell you something  south carolina does want to win  they want to win more than anybody  and we're not going to change a thing  because we're winning like never

3,2,Mar,2020,datasets/Charlotte,"i want to thank you very much  north carolina  thank you very much  i'm thrilled to back in the great city of charlotte  where  by the way  we're having our convention  i guess you heard that  right  with thousands of hardworking american patriots who love our country  cherish our values  respect our laws and always put america first  eight months from now  we're going to defeat the radical socialists  we're going to win the great state of north carolina in a landslide  we won it last time  we're going to win it this time by even more  and you know  eric and lara named their daughter  you know what her name is  carolina  carolina  her name is carolina for a reason  this is an incredible time for our nation  our country is stronger than ever before  and today  we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history  that's great  that's great  that was great  you know  our opponents were saying  "" oh  maybe he's in trouble  maybe the economy 窶ｦ "" they'll do anything  they'll do anything  i'm sure they were thrilled  do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today  i don't think so  by the way  look at this  look back there  look at all of that press  look at all them  man  i don't know if sleepy joe  or bernie  i don't think they have that much press  bernie was going wild  why would i be here tonight  why would i be here  he said why would i be here tonight  we don't have the primary  we've already won the thing  you know  i was going to say the you know what thing  i held it back  because they'll say  ""horrible language  he used horrible language today "" but we're doing fantastically  there's never been a time where the republican party was so unified as it is now  never  never  and you hear about enthusiasm for crazy bernie  and that's true  he does have some enthusiasm  but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people  too  and there's not a lot of enthusiasm for biden  i thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the senate  i looked at the first lady  i said  "" hey  he's running for the senate "" and today he just said super thursday  he's looking forward to super thursday  jobs are booming in our country  incomes are soaring  poverty has plummeted  confidence is surging  and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the united states military  every day  for me and for you  it's promises made  promises kept  one of the most important promises i made is right to this era  you know  we look at it  it's the never ending wars in the middle east  we're taking our soldiers  we're bringing them back home  we're not law enforcement  we're bringing them back home  american troops cannot be the policemen for the world  or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it  the job of the american military is to secure and defend our country  two days ago  the unites states signed a deal with the taliban so that after 19 years of conflict  and very close to 20  we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home  after years of rebuilding foreign nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own american citizens and all of the things that we've done  we've wiped out the terrorists  we've done so much  and you know what  we're 8 000 miles away  you got a lot of big countries surrounding afghanistan  you've got afghanistan itself  the progress that was made  was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform  you know that  we pay a special tribute  and i know you pay it  a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice  as we bring back our troops  we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to america in the first place  they're not coming here  and if they do  bad things happen to them  we must keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  by the way  i have to say this  you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside  somebody was saying that if pocahontas  any one of them  sleepy joe  he doesn't have that  so he doesn't have a lot  he has very small crowds  but if sleepy joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size  they go around talking about how big the crowd  they never say that  hey  take your cameras and spin them around this big arena  right now  spin them around  no fun to be a protestor at a trump rally  but do we have a great time at a trump rally  my administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect americans from the coronavirus  you know about this whole thing  horrible  including  sweeping travel restrictions  today  we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies  and they're really working hard  and they're working smart  and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies  they're going to have vaccines i think relatively soon  and they're going to have something that makes you better  and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner  so a lot of good things are happening  but we have strong borders  and really  our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right  we went out  we're doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country  we're working on that very hard  we closed our borders very early  i took a lot of heat for that  remember when i closed the borders to certain areas of the world  i took a lot of heat  but there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection  think of it  keep all of the infection  let it come in  and we're working with other countries  in all fairness  look  it's a problem  we're working with other countries  remember this  over the last long period of time  the flu  the common flu  you know this  right  from 27 000 to 70 000 people get infected  and many people die  think of it  27 000  you lose 27 000 people to the common flu  it can be much more  one year was much higher than the 70 000 number  those people died  so when you lose 27 000 people a year  nobody knew that  i didn't know that  three  four weeks ago  i was sitting there  i said  ""what do we lose with the regular flu "" they said  ""about 27 000 minimum  goes up to 70  sometimes even 80  one year it went up to 100 000 people "" i said  ""nobody told me that  nobody knows that "" last year was approximately 36 000 people died  so we're working hard on it  and we're going to come up with some really great solutions  in the meantime  we're stopping 窶ｦ only in north carolina  only in north carolina  it can only be  how many people here are from south carolina  by the way  all right  we love both places  but that was from north carolina  but just to finish up  so we've made a lot of progress  we've really done a great job with it  we're keeping our borders strong  my job is to protect the health of american patients and americans first  and that's what i'll do  washington democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus  denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals  but honestly  not so much anymore  everyone appreciates  these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do  we're actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very  very big problems  so we have our professionals in constant touch  i'm in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out  but the political attacks from some of the democrats really must stop  we've got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people  we're going to safeguard our people  the united states  the united states is  right now  ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness  earlier today  when i met with the pharmaceutical companies  things were discussed and learned honestly  the media didn't know  nobody knew  they've never heard this before  and we learned a lot  and maybe that had the impact on the stock market  who knows what happened  but we're going to reduce and the severity of what's happening  the duration of the virus  we discussed all of these things  we will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible  and i have to say  with a thriving economy the way it is  and the most advanced health system on earth  america is so resilient  we know what we're doing  we have the greatest people on earth  the greatest health system on earth  we have the greatest health system on earth  the renewal of american strength over the last three years means at times of challenge  we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion  no country is better equipped than america to handle new threats  and no people are more skilled  talented  tough  or driven than americans  and together  we are in the midst of the great american comeback  that's what it is  last month  we added 225 000 new jobs in january alone  that makes seven million jobs since the election  we have destroyed the isis territorial caliphate  and we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  he is dead  and we took out the world's top terrorist  qasem soleimani  ending his evil reign on terror forever  soleimani  while the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts  we have been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  and lifting up american citizens of every race  religion  color  and creed  tomorrow  voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for super tuesday  not super thursday  no  he said  ""super thursday "" you can't do these things  can you imagine if i said super thursday  it would be over  right  i would be over  no matter how good you are at certain things  you can't  as an example  a name like sleepy joe  he's constantly naming the wrong state  ""it's great to be in the state of ohio "" no  no  no  i'm sorry  you're in north carolina  no  no  joe  do you ever see them run up with a sign  ""no  no  north carolina  joe "" once that happens  you might as well leave the states  because it's a disaster no matter how good you're doing  we're in north carolina  it's great to be in idaho  no  you're in iowa  nah  he makes a lot of those mistakes  they're a little scary  we're going to protect your second amendment  you understand that  but did you see  sleepy joe  did you see sleepy joe  where he said  ""last year  150 million people were killed by guns in our country "" 150 million  that means 50% of our country  that's a big story  150  can you imagine trump saying that  these people would never let me live it down  we can't make even a little mistake  we can't make even a little  tiny  tiny mistake  if we make a tiny mistake  it's headlining  they say things like 150 million people killed  guns  they say super thursday  they say georgia  he's looking forward to winning georgia tomorrow  georgia's not in super tuesday  so many mistakes  you can't do that when you're negotiating with china  can't do that when you're negotiating with these countries  can you  those mistakes would be very tremendous  then you have mini mike  you see this guy  can you believe it  mini mike  he's being interviewed tonight on fox  can you believe it  fox  they want to be politically correct  they want to interview  they end up interviewing more democrats than republic 窶ｦ i don't know what's going on with fox  but they're interviewing this guy the night before 窶ｦ mini mike  ay  ay  ay  what a mess he is  the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history  the worst in history  nah  i got to have more  i'd get down real low  but i don't want to copy him  everybody saw it  everyone said  ""oh "" they all say  ""oh  do that again where you get down low "" but if i do that again  it's a copy  it's a copy  no  no  no  you never like to copy  even though you're copying yourself  you don't like to copy  you do it once  it was a big hit  but you do it once  and you sort of say  ""that was nice  don't do it again "" because if it doesn't work the second time  it gets embarrassing  right  right  we all know  but no  he's a disaster waiting to happen  he's a mess  no matter which democrat candidate you're talking about  and you understand that  any one of these candidates 窶ｦ and you see what's happening  right  it's being rigged against 窶ｦ it's sad  it's being rigged against crazy bernie  crazy bernie is going to go crazy  crazy  i think crazy bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they're doing  i called it a long time ago  mayor pete buttigieg  buttigieg  may pete  he quit  out last night  then i hear a senator from a state we're going to win  we're going to win that state  but she dropped out  sounds like they made a deal  they both supported sleepy joe  you know why  they made a deal  you know why  quid pro quo  that's why  don't care  quid pro quo  quid pro quo  they made a deal  impeach them  they should be impeached  they should be impeached  quid pro quo  but they've embraced an extreme left wing agenda  their plans would massively raise your taxes  destroy our liberty  muzzle our faith  and erase our sovereignty  you know that  the democrat party has gone crazy  whether it's bernie sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare  elizabeth pocahontas's plan 窶ｦ by the way  she's history  she's history  i came up with that name far too early  i should've just waited  but it didn't matter  i thought she was making a come back  i said  ""wow  i just did it to her "" but you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago  they never caught on  in fact  she'll probably lose the state of massachusetts to bernie  so she doesn't know what to do because you're not supposed to lose the state of massachusetts if you get in there  she's the senator  she's the senator for massachusetts  i think she's going to lose it to bernie  and miss michigan  you see what's going on over there  michigan  we're leading  we're leading in wisconsin  we're leading in florida  we're leading in the last election  hey  how great was the 2016 election  one of the greatest nights  one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television  and remember  there was oh  this is going to be a quick one  this is going to be窶ｦ oh  that wasn't so easy for them  i love the scene  the scene of that convention center where hillary was getting ready to speak  and then she found out she lost  but elizabeth warren's here to plan to eliminate our borders  or mini mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment  mike bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment  don't worry about it  it's not going to happen  not going to happen for him  for sleepy joe  he doesn't even know where he is  what he's doing  or what office he's running for  actually  i honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for  and it doesn't matter  maybe he gets in  because he's a little more moderate  so maybe he gets in  but he's not going to be running it  other people are going to  they're going to put him into a home  and other people are going to be running the country  but they're going to be super left radical crazies  they're going to be super left radical crazies  joe's going to be in a home  he'll be watching television  everything will be just fine  the insanity of washington democrats is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement  they are joining our great republican party  we have the enthusiasm in our party  no  i really mean it  i constantly hear about the enthusiasm  they're fighting each other  they hate each other  they don't know what's going on  we have all the love  we have all the enthusiasm  and we know what we're doing  we know what we're doing  so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great  terrific  brilliant  wonderful warriors  even though he comes from a slightly different state  but not to far by  is somebody that really has distinguished himself  he's become a great friend of mine  what he did for justice kavanaugh  do you remember that  one of the greatest statements ever made in the united state's senate  senator lindsey graham  come on up  lindsey  lindsey graham  come on up  lindsey  come here  lindsey  i got to have him say something  come here  lindsey  great guy  they handle pressure so well  they came and we gave a rally that was like this and dan bishop and gregg murphy won by so much  it wasn't even close  they're great people  and they've done a fantastic job  thank you very much  they handle pressure  they were under a lot of pressure  they handled it well  it's nice to know people can handle pressure  there aren't too many of them  north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley  thank you  michael  i have a few great friends of mine and they love north carolina  louis dejoy  who you know  louis dejoy  two great people  diamond and silk  right  diamond and silk  we love them  you know the first lady  a long time ago now  right  how long is that  probably almost almost five years ago  she said  ""there are these two women on the internet  they're unbelievable  they're unbelievable "" i said  ""oh  i know  i hear that all the time  i hear it all the time "" she said  the next day she came again  she said  ""i saw them again  they're unbelievable "" i said  ""let me see "" i saw them  i fell in love with it  and everybody fell in love with diamond and silk  so thank you  some people that have really been helpful to me  corey lewandowski  david bussey  and pam bondi  right here  thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 republican national convention right here in charlotte an outstanding success  rnc chairman ronna mcdaniel  rnc co chairman tommy hicks  and convention president marcia lee kelly  thank you all  you're doing a great job  i'll tell you they're looking  they're going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job  should we doing a great job  but just an okay job  it doesn't matter as long as you win  you know what i gave when we won last time  somebody else took them to convention center  spent a fortune and i just took a hotel ballroom  i said  ""what the heck  if i win  nobody cares  if i don't "" look if you win  nobody cares what room you're in  if you lose  nobody cares what room you're in  so we took a ballroom  nice ballroom  that's it  no big deal  i think it this way  if we win  nobody cares  and if we lose  i'm out of there  i save a hell of a lot of money  every place that we've gone  it's been amazing  i'd also like to recognize  so important  a woman who's really helped us win north carolina in 2016  i have a feeling this year  she'll even do better  because she happened to grow up here  lara trump and my son eric trump  two great people  i mean i have to say that about my son  but i know a lot of people don't like their sons that much  but lara has been fantastic  and thank you very much  what a job  she knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here  how are we doing  lara  how are we doing  how are we doing in the state  are we doing good  and we're doing well in pennsylvania i hear  and south carolina  i know we're doing great there  also with us tonight  is a man who's really become a good friend of mine  we were going at it a little bit at the beginning  but i will tell you  and i would say if i didn't get along  i would not be here  i wouldn't do this  i think he's been tremendous  he's been a tremendous supporter and things that we've wanted to do  and fights that we've had which were so important  he's been right up  and lizzie will tell you that he's been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term  probably a lot longer than that  but he's going to come up and i'm going to ask senator thom tillis  come on up  thom has really been incredible  he's been working everyday  and he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight  and take care of our amazing veterans  and stop illegal immigration  thom is the champion for the people of north carolina  this november  we need everybody to go and vote for thom  he's doing great  he's doing great  i hear he's way up in the polls  he's way up in the polls  thom  say a few words  ""get me off this stage  get me off  you guys didn't tell me this was going to happen "" no  that was great thom  we're also honored to be joined tonight by a true american hero  a veteran of world war ii and the korean war who just turned 100 years old  his name is george washington perry  legit  george  thank you very much for being here  thank you  george  100 years  he's 100 and he looks good  thank you  george  with the help of everyone here tonight  america has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth  since my election over 219 000 new jobs have been created right here in north carolina  we have lifted 10 000 000 people off of welfare  including 7 000 000 people off of food stamps  median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded  think of that  the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history  that's happening  that's happening  the unemployment rate among african americans  hispanic americans  and asian americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history  very important to me  african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low  african american poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded  for decades democratic politicians betrayed  and they truly did  they betrayed african americans  my administration is delivering for african americans like never before  no president has done more for our black community  no president has done more for our black community  and it's an honor to do it  last month here in charlotte  we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all americans  it's called opportunity now  you know about it  we're also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave  reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 000 000 american families an average of  2 200 thanks to the republican child tax credit  the republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did  but the democrats are saying  ""how did they do that one ""  the usmca is a giant for north carolina's incredible farmers and factory workers  and by the way  speaking of farms  factory workers  and small businesses  are all for the death tax  you know about the death tax  right  it's called the inheritance tax  you have a small farm some place  you have a small business  you have a nice business  you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax  so if you want to leave it to your children  you can leave it to your children  there's no tax to be paid by your children  so they don't have to go back to the evil banker  borrow money from the banker  lose the farm  lose the business  it won't happen  and i always say  i know a lot of parents that don't love the children very much  is there anybody in this room that does not love your children  please raise your hand  please raise your hand  nobody  nobody  that's because we're north carolina  you love your children  but if you don't  then it doesn't matter because if you don't love your children  don't leave them a damn thing  but you don't have the inheritance tax anymore  which is great  a lot of people don't even know that  but that's a big deal or no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betraying the american people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities  which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities  right here in north carolina  believe it or not  the sanctuary county of durham released an illegal alien criminal  who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year  you know all about it  killing her and dumping her body into the woods  last year alone  sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina  how did that happen to north carolina  deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of  and these are really dangerous criminal aliens  including those charged or convicted of burglary  gun crime  sexual assault  kidnapping  and even suffering they inflict on our people  we're building the wall  we're building the wall  we're building the wall  we're building the wall  mexico's paying for the wall  by the way  we built 127 miles as of today  127  mexico is paying for the wall  the media is going to be thrilled when i explain that mexico is paying for the wall because you know  now finally they said i've had obstruction like you wouldn't believe  the entire democratic party  i could get anything  i created space force  i could do anything  i could get  lindsey and thom tillis knows  mark knows this  all of them knows this  if i wanted 25 cents for the wall  they didn't want to get it  they didn't want to do it  but now we got it  and you think that's easy  nobody else could have done this  we're building it  we're building our hearts away  we'll soon be building many  many miles a week  but we're up to over 125  i guess 127  28 by now  of the super duper wall  super duper  i went to border patrol  i said  "" what is your wish "" ""well  sir  we'd like it to be steel and concrete "" they want it exactly what they have it  and the barriers up top  they want everything  it's called a no climb provisor  no climb provisor  i said  ""what does the word provisor mean "" they didn't know  all it means is you're not able to climb over it  it is very tough  i don't know if you saw  in a part of the wall  a couple of weeks ago  they were climbing the wall  and the fire department had to come and take them down  that's what the no climb is  that's what the no climb is  it's a no climb  it's more money  it's a little more expensive  thank you  who is that  what a voice  pavarotti  so  we're building the wall  it's going great  so  they said  ""all right  he's building the wall  but mexico's not paying for it "" yes  they are  you'll see  you'll see  you understand  some of you understand because i told a few people last week  it got linked to the fake news media  if you want to end sanctuary cities in north carolina and across america  then you have only one choice  you must vote republican  you have to  you have to  we've added catch and release  one of the worst loopholes you've ever seen  catch and release  you catch them  you then say  ""where do you live "" they don't know because look  let's face it  they don't know  i understand that  it's not even to be laughed at  they don't know  ""where do you live "" i don't know  mexico  maybe  honduras  guatemala  who knows  el salvador  ""where do you live "" like this guy  he's a mexican  you're about as mexican as i am  look at this guy  he's as mexican as i am  look at that hat  are you mexican  are you mexican  no  you're not  are you  he is  it's like elizabeth warren  she said she was an indian  i said  ""i have more indian blood in me than you have  and i have none  she said  ""oh  this is terrible "" so she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her  right  1024th  right  one thousandths  so i was right  i probably have more in me  what a phony she is  what a phony  washington democrats have never been more extreme  132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' healthcare takeover  while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security  and they are going to destroy your social security  remember they used to say with me  ""i'm going to end it the first day "" well  you know what  we're going to soon be four years and all i've done is make it stronger  you know that  my administration is protecting your social security  your medicare  and is fighting to give you great healthcare  you're going to have great health  we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice  remember president obama  you can keep your doctor  you can keep your plan  28 times  they said  ""impeach him  you should impeach him "" 28 times he lied  28 times on record  ""you can keep your doctor  you can keep your plan "" well  that's not true  it wasn't  impeach him  we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office  we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better plans  we are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will  and we are trying terminate  in the supreme court of the united states  the worst healthcare in the world  and we are going to give you the best healthcare you've ever seen at a low price and again  protecting preexisting conditions  protecting preexisting conditions  we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing  you know what that is  surprise  you get all sorts of surprises  we have people that take a blood test in one place  it's  26  and in another place it's  2000  same blood test  maybe the cheap one is better  who knows  same blood test  it's wrong  surprise medical building  bombed  out  billing  i signed an executive order opposing price transparency that's going to be bigger than healthcare  because when providers are required to show their prices  those same prices fall very  very fast  right  it's a big thing  it's a big thing  we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs  which are just as good as name brand drugs  but a fraction of the cost  we have given them  and there's a lot of political pressure not to do that  you can understand why  to care for our amazing veterans  we passed va choice and va accountability  and nobody said it could be done  so now  instead of waiting in line for days and days  and weeks and weeks to see a doctor  you go outside  you get a doctor  we pay the bill  you get all fixed up  what a great thing  it's called va choice  i got it done  they've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven't been able to  those people over there were a great help  we have passed the spectacular right to try  you know what that is  hopefully nobody in the room needs  hopefully nobody in the room needs right to try  we are combating the opioid epidemic  drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years  we've launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and alzheimer's  and we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients  and breaking all records in so doing  virtually every democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the very moment of birth  how about that  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god  then you have the governor of virginia  the baby is born  the baby is born and he says  ""and then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby "" this is the governor of virginia  the governor of virginia  he's a beauty  you remember what he did  he wanted to dance like michael jackson and his wife stopped him  he got lucky  but the governor of virginia wanted to do that  the baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother  the doctor will now talk  and you'll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives  did you ever hear of anything like this  the democratic party is the party of high taxes  high crime  unlimited regulations  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  blatant corruption  and the total obliteration of your second amendment  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and the late great abraham lincoln  so many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight  and we're doing it for school choice  so that every child who needs it  gets it  no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school  i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life  alice johnson  do we love alice johnson  this could not have been done by anyone other than the republican party  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  our historic investments in the united states military include  200 million to a place that nobody's heard of in this audience  i'm sure  fort bragg   300 million for marine corps air station cherry point  more than  500 million for marine corps air station new river  listen to this one  no democrat's going to this  they don't even want to spend money on the military  they don't like the military  they're not going to spend money   1 2 billion for camp lejeune   1 2 billion  do you think that a guy like sleepy joe's going to put  he doesn't know what it means  i know what i means  we have to have a strong military  we have the strongest military we've ever had  when i came in  our military was in sad shape  it was depleted  but we've rebuilt it   2 5 trillion dollars went into our military  01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself  if you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of americans who fought and died to secure  and you know what they're securing  they are securing us  they're securing our freedom  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november  november 3rd to be exact  only this way can we save the america we love  and drain the

epidemic in less than nine years  we've already started  who would have thought  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms  your second amendment rights are under siege  believe me  they're under siege  we don't get in  you can forget your second amendment  that's what i think  i really believe it  above all  we will never stop fighting for the

4,1,Aug,2019,datasets/Cincinnati,"thank you all  thank you very much  thank you to vice president mike pence  and hello cincinnati  you know  i used to work in cincinnati  a place called swifton village  you know what that is  swifton village  it was good and it worked out well  and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age  and look what happened to all of us  right  look what happened  look what happened  i was watching the so-called debate last night  and i also watched the night before that was long  long television  the democrats spent more time attacking barack obama than they did attacking me practically  this morning  that's all the fake news was talking about  it's all they were talking about  that wasn't pretty  no  we're doing good  it's great to be back in the state that i love  i love this state  very special  very  very special  on the banks of the beautiful ohio river with the hardworking patriots of the american heartland  thank you  ohio  we love you  ohio  we've got thousands of people standing outside  and i asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles  can they sit on the stairs  but i'll tell you what  this is some crowd  some turnout  we've sold tens of thousands of tickets  and  you know what the sale price is  we keep it nice and low  we keep it nice and low  but  there never has been a movement like this  this is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before  maybe anywhere  but certainly in this country  they've never seen anything like this before  you came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers  and you came for 窶ｦ i mean  look  from wherever you came from  there were a lot of you  and  they showed up on election day  i'll never forget  a wonderful congressman from tennessee  they have early voting  and one of the earliest places  great state  tennessee  and he was in pennsylvania with me  great state  and he said  ""you know  sir  i've been doing this for a long time  but i've never seen people like this show up for early voting  people that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for "" he said  ""i've never seen it  they have trump banners  and trump hats  and trump buttons  i've never seen it "" this great congressman said  ""i don't know  sir  but i can tell you one thing  if the rest of the country is voting like tennessee is voting  you're going to win by a lot "" and  we won  and we won by a lot  we won by a lot  our nation is stronger today than ever before  the number one economy on earth  no economy is so strong  we're rebuilding the awesome might of the united states military  and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history  and when we took over  it was depleted  we took over a depleted military  it's not depleted anymore  i can tell you that  our spirit is strong  our stride is back and our stand is clear  we are finally putting america first  it's about time  we've created six million new jobs since election day  nobody would've thought that was possible  more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps  and they're happy  they're happy  123 000 more ohio workers are employed today than when i was elected  think of that number  and  right now  ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country  thank you  congratulations  ohio  stand up  mike  and  you have a good governor  i want to tell you that  good job  mike  unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for african-americans  hispanic-americans and asian-americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded  while republicans are working every day to build up our country  the rage-filled democrat party is trying to tear america apart  the democrat party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear  no one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than americans living in our nation's inner cities  they have paid a dear price  do you see what's happening  you see our inner cities  we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years  and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame  for decades  these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians  and it's been total one party control of the inner cities  for a hundred years  it's been one party control and look at them  we can name one after another  but i won't do that because i don't want to be controversial  we want no controversy  no controversy  the democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay  total decay  the democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence  they've squeezed the blood out of them  left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice  trapping children and failing in government schools left and right  so many of these mayors right now  you know where they are  they're in jail  that's where they are  republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice  but the greatest betrayal committed by the democrats is their support for open borders  these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals  drain public services  and flood communities with poisonous drugs  it's tough enough  and i want to thank  by the way  the country of mexico  they've got 21 000 soldiers on the border right now  i'm starting to like mexico a lot  they do a lot more for us than the democrats do  right  a lot more  a lot more  and  the numbers are way down  you'll see that  way  way down  democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents  they put foreign citizens before american citizens  we're not going to do that  572 people were murdered in chicago last year  so  you got a lot of hot people outside  but we broke the all time record  the homicide rate in baltimore is significantly higher than el salvador  honduras  guatemala  i believe it's higher than 窶ｦ give me a place that you think is pretty bad  give me a place  the guy says afghanistan  i believe it's higher than afghanistan in our country  think of that  i believe  we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong  they will tell us tomorrow  it'll be headlines  trump exaggerated  i do believe the rate is higher than afghanistan  yet democrats  and they've run it for many years  want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities  no good  no good  the conditions in nancy pelosi's once great city of san francisco are deplorable  they're deplorable  do you remember the word deplorable  do you remember when hillary used the deplorable  she used two words  she used deplorable and irredeemable  right  and only being a politician for a few years  i said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable  but it turned out to be deplorable  deplorable was not a good day for hillary  crooked hillary  she is a crooked one she's crooked  she is crooked  nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in america happen to live in the state of california  what they are doing to our beautiful california is a disgrace to our country  it's a shame the world is looking at it  look at los angeles  with the tents and the horrible  horrible  disgusting conditions  look at san francisco  look at some of your other cities  and then you have a governor 窶ｦ you have a governor that invites the whole world to come into california  we'll pay for your healthcare  then you wonder why so many people are coming up  they're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world  but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say  ""come on up  we'll give you healthcare  come "" who wouldn't come up  who wouldn't come up  how crazy is this  how crazy is this  schools  healthcare  today  i've a simple proposal for democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration  and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities  that's the way we should be doing it  that's what we should be doing  by the way  you know  they keep talking about  "" oh  the voters  the voters  the voters "" they want all sorts of security  what about a thing called voter id  voter identification  rob portman  please work on that  rob portman  you have a great senator  would you please start working on that  you see the response  every place i go  rob  please  rob  voter id  they give you everything they can give you except voter id and the things that matter  republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first  our pledge to america's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions americans for the jobs of tomorrow  you know who's working very hard on that  you probably never heard of her  ivanka trump  she's working very hard  she gave up a lot  she had a very easy life  but she loves doing it  she's got over  i think  now 12 million people  they're teaching them the great companies of our country  they're teaching people how to do it  and it's an incredible thing to watch  to give former prisoners a second chance at life  we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us  president obama tried  a lot of them tried  they couldn't get it passed  i got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives  and a lot of help  and  the biggest beneficiary is the african-american community  biggest beneficiary  and  something which a lot of people don't talk about  but we doubled the child tax credit  doubled it  our tax plan also created nearly 9 000 opportunity zones  hottest thing going  providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities  left together  i put out a six minute video detailing everything i found unacceptable about liberalism and the democrat party  take your time  take your time  walk away  doctor  doctor in the house  please  okay  thank you very much  thank you very much  thank you  thank you  thank you  doctor  thank you  don't forget  it's a hundred degrees in here  that person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it  a lot of you  so i appreciate it  and you know what  they'll come back  they'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this  there's never been anything  right  never been  thank you  incredible  we established more than 300 opportunity zones in ohio alone  and these are really working out incredibly well  nationwide  nearly eight million african-americans live in opportunity zones  but every democrat voted against them  every single democrat  because they vote as a block  it's the only thing they do good  they stick together  their policies  no good  they're lousy politicians  but they stick together like glue  it's the only thing they have  that's the only thing they have going  democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves  republicans deliver jobs  safety and opportunity for all americans  we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders  and we'll start off with a man who had a very  very tough race for governor  a lot of people choke  they choke like dogs  they can't breathe  aw  they can't breathe  this guy was running against a so-called star 窶ｦ so  that's two protestors  and tomorrow night the headline will be  protesters  protesters  you know what happened to the second one  he looked at the guy in front of him and he said  ""ah  i'm out of here  bye "" that's the way it works  that's the way it works  i guess  too bad  but  a man who really has done a fantastic job  he campaigned so hard  and this was a star right from the fields of the great pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency  if possible  she's trying to win  remember  she defrauded people with her credentials  she said she was indian  and i said that i have more indian blood than she does  and i have none  i'm sorry  we drove her crazy  and  we drove her crazy  that's a good thing  not a bad thing  she went out and she had a blood test done  and it came out 1 024th  he said  "" somewhere back there  hundreds of years ago  there may have been an indian  or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small "" which  it was  anyway  but the guy was from her group  you wouldn't be very happy right now  and we have a man that campaigned so hard  relentless  i came in  we did a rally where we had people like this  it was packed the day before the election and mike dewine won that election  -and mike dewine won that election and he won it easily  mike dewine  we have a man who's running for governor of kentucky again  and he's done an incredible job  and did you ever hear  sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it  but they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct  but when you correct it  you make yourself a little bit less popular  but he had no choice and they had no choice  it's a great  great state and he has turned out to be a great  great governor  matt bevin  he's running in november  and because i like him so much  matt get a nice big arena ready  we're going to do a rally for you  and a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who i just met  incredible  when i ran with him  he was down  i said  ""rob portman's down "" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points  i said  ""what the hell did you do "" and you know what he did  he does a great job  that's what he did  senator rob portman  great guy  and we have a few guys that  these are warriors  a couple of them you saw the other day  they were questioning bob mueller  that was a beauty  he was sharp  wasn't he he was sharp as a tack and steve chabot and brad wenstrup  and warren davidson and andy barr and a man named greg pence who happens to be a brother of somebody i know very well  they have been with us through thick and thin  and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done  no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done  thank you fellas  great job  a couple of them gave a grilling  they gave a grilling  all they had to do is mention the facts and it was over  and also the auditor of the great state of ohio  a man whose job i made much easier because you have money pouring in  you have companies pouring in  keith faber  how is it keith  the numbers are good  keith  numbers are good  right  yeah  the numbers are good  ohio senate president  larry obhof  larry  thank you  great job  nice tie  i like larry's tie  and you have a couple of people that are very  very powerful  i hear that office and i shudder  ohio supreme court justices  sharon kennedy and judy french  thank you  please don't recuse yourself because i gave you a nice welcome  should i ever be before you  i love judges  when they see you for about two seconds and then you say  oh  that judge should be fair  and then they say  ""i'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago i met donald trump "" i'd never have been in窶ｦ we've been doing very well in the courts  by the way  have you seen  we've been winning a lot of cases  a lot of cases  we really have   179  percentage wise  it's the second most  we will never be number one  sadly we'll never be number one  so percentage wise  nobody's ever seen anything like it  and that's because president obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in  which is a shame  and i came in  i had 148 openings  you're supposed to have none  i said  ""how many do we have "" 148  and i said  ""you got to be kidding "" and we've all done a good job together  it's been amazing  with mitch and you and everybody  it's been amazing  so we're going to be up to  within two months  179 federal judges  that's in two and a half years  and what else  two great supreme court judges  great ones  there's only one person  i think most of you must know this  who percentage wise has done better than me with judges  tell me  i'll give you a hint  he appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the united states supreme court  george washington  that's one record we're not going to beat  but i appointed many more than him  so let's take it that way  many anymore  i also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job  she's really something  she has been incredible as a leader of the gop  she's the chair and she's my friend jane timken  and aman bob paduchik  you know bob paduchik  so bob  i had to pick campaign manager in ohio and i kept hearing from the media  ""you must win the state of ohio "" i heard this over and over for like a year and a half  ""you must win ohio  you must win "" so i had to pick a campaign manager and i picked a man named bob paduchik  and no matter what happened  no matter how badly we were doing  he said  ""sir  you're going to win ohio easily "" i said  ""but bob  we just lost the head of the gop in ohio  he left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave "" great support from the governor  a different governor than mike by the way  slightly  so he had to get out  so i said  ""we just lost "" and bob said  ""don't worry about it  sir  you're going to win  in fact  i think you just went up "" then we lost a couple of other people  i'd call him  i say  ""bob  i'm worried about ohio  very worried "" he said  ""don't worry about it  sir  i think he just went up "" he kept saying  ""you just went up "" i said to somebody  ""i don't know much about this guy  but boy  he's the most optimistic person i've ever met "" true  he said  ""don't worry "" we ended up winning ohio by close to nine points  which is unheard of  he was right  bob paduchik  bob  and also here tonight  i don't know  did he do a good job  my son  donald jr  and kimberly  i hope he did a good job  good  i heard you did  i heard you did a great job  he's been a great help  they both have  thank you very much  thank you  kimberly  thank you very much  our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs  pro family pro growth and 100% pro american  we've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations  giving the average american household  3 000 more to spend every single year  the previous administration tried to shut down american energy and close up  totally  close it up  american clean  beautiful coal  that's what they did  that didn't work out too well  but you had a suffer  it didn't work out well  but get a suffer for a long time until i came along  you're not suffering any longer  the previous administration  they liked to windmills  if a windmill is within two miles of your house  your house is practically worthless  they make noise  they're intermittent  they kill your birds  they break down all the time  you have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out  and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy  other than that  they're quite good  you don't want one of those windmills within vision  you hear them  they're noisy  they've got a lot of problems  no  we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses  that's creating so many jobs  and solar  you know what  we'll live with solar  but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need  but we're going to stay the way we have it  we've ended the war on american energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work  and our auto companies back to work  we've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country  we're very lucky  we're now the largest energy producer in the entire world  bigger than soviet union  formerly  remember the soviet union when it was all together  the soviet union  when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves russia  when it was all together  they wanted to be  that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world  then it became russia and you know what  they've done a good job with energy and so has saudi arabia done a good job with energy  but we're now bigger than russia  we are now bigger than saudi arabia by far  i withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive paris climate accord  last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016  92%  do you believe that  you're shipping it all over the world  to vietnam  i was in vietnam and they said  ""we get coal from ohio  we get coal from west virginia  it's the finest coal in the world "" we've created more than 110 000 new mining jobs  and thanks to states like ohio the united states is now the number one producer of oil  the number one producer of natural gas  the number one everything having to do with energy  number one  anywhere in the world  we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs  plunder our factories  and devastate ohio communities and communities in every state  the era of economic surrender is over  and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time  nafta was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal  you still have empty buildings  empty factories  but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones  we have hundreds of new companies pouring into the united states  my first week in office  i withdrew the united states from one of the last administration's worst sellouts  it would have destroyed our automobile industry  it would have destroyed manufacturing in this country  and maybe that's what president obama meant when he said  you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the united states  because he would've signed trans pacific partnership and he would've been right  i killed it  and by the way  tpp  trans pacific partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already  already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to mexico  under the new usmca  that's mexico and canada  we've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal  but under the new窶ｦ it's going to be very hard for companies to leave you  to fire you  to go down to make their product  whatever it may be  to send it back into the united states with no tax  all we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings  so they got to vote  on the usmca  before i took office  foreign countries ripped us off  robbed us blind  and pushed us around  but america is not being pushed around anymore  do you realize that  i got that from working in ohio for two summers  we've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china's trade abuse  and i just announced another 10% tariff on  300 billion worth of chinese products that come into our country  and that's on top of the 25% that we take off  250 billion coming in from china  and don't let them tell you  the fact is china devalues their currency  they pour money into their system  they pour it in  and because they do that  you're not paying for those tariffs  china's paying for those tariffs  for the last 20 years  china's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country  and now we're stopping the theft of american jobs  we're stopping the theft of so many other things happening  including intellectual property  they steal our intellectual property  i think they want to try and make a deal with us  but i'm not sure  because the word is  i feel they want to wait until they get窶ｦ they're praying  they're praying  they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the united states like they've been doing for the last 25 years  would love to see a guy like sleepy joe biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing  they say to sleepy joe  sir  ""just sign right there "" ""oh  okay  i'll sign "" we'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china  it has to stop but they understand that  president xi is good man  he's a friend of mine  he understands it  and until such time as there is a deal  we will be taxing the hell out of china  that's all there   make your product in america  come on back to the united states  come on back to ohio  there's no tariff  there's no tariff  thanks to steel tariffs  hundreds of thousands of tons  think of this  were dumped on our shores  and steel is like something else  it's that quality  they were dumping garbage  they call it sand steel  they call it dirt steel  it was mixed up  it was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building  but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel  and what was happening is united states steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and i stopped it  i put on a 25% tariff  billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back  right here in ohio  nucor a great steel company  and a steel company that's doing great again  nucor  has announced an  85 million upgrade in marion  charter steel announced plans to build a new  150 million steel mill in cuyahoga heights  and cleveland cliffs announced a new  700 million plant in a very good place that i like a lot  toledo  toledo  ohio  this was unthinkable because four years ago  steel plans were closing  they weren't expanding or they weren't building  we're building new plants in florida  north carolina  south carolina  all over  not just ohio  on issue after issue  democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent  they forgot  i wonder why they forgot  the job of elected officials is to represent american citizens  the radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets  sanctuary cities  many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there  they don't want them  they don't want them  they're dangerous and not good  here are just a few examples  in san francisco  an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft  yet each time san francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free  a sanctuary jurisdiction in california recently released a criminal alien from jail  the very next month  the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe  a horrible thing happened  but yet again  he was released back into your community  after sanctuary city in new jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence  he was arrested in missouri for the murders of three people  in the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left  they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent americans for a single politically incorrect thought  but they want to virtually  and you know this  they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder  horrible crimes and murder  republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans  not criminal aliens  and yes just won a big lawsuit last week  in fact  on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight  i gave him a little reprieve  we need a lot of lawyers in the white house  we get sued so much  so unfairly  but we're winning those lawsuits left and right  but one of them is here  he said  ""i'd love to go to a rally "" i said  "" i'm going to a place called cincinnati  ohio  you deserve it "" we just won the lawsuit on the wall  where's pat  we just won the lawsuit on the wall  you hear that  we're building the wall faster and better than ever  it's time for democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release  you know what you do  you catch them and then you release them and you say  ""would you please report back in four years from now "" but only 2% come back  you know why  because they're not the smartest  they are not the smartest  they're the ones we don't want to have come back  only 2% show up  catch and release  we could end it immediately if the democrats caved  so what we're doing is something else  we're keeping them out altogether  we're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system  how about the lottery system  how about lotteries  this was chuck schumer  you put the name in a basket  the country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery  well  let's see  this one's a murderer  this one robbed four banks  this one  i better not say  this one  another murder  ladies and gentlemen  another murderer  think of this  do you think they're going to put great citizens窶ｦ they have great citizens  they have great people like we have great people  do you think those people are going into a lottery  no  and then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country  the country isn't based on that  the country  you just take a look  look at the people they put into these lotteries  it's a disgrace  and how we've done this for so many years folks  how we've done this  it's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the house  we're going to win the senate  we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system  merit based  merit based immigration  and we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers  we need good people  we're down to 3 5% unemployment  we need people  but we want people to come in based on merit  not based on some lottery put in by a governor  democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream  liberal politicians want to eliminate private- dream  liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan  remember the lies from the previous administration  if you like your plan  you can keep your plan  if you like your doctor  you can keep your doctor  28 time  one lie after another  28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie  my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you  we're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions  always  always  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  and then you'll have like a governor of virginia  it's not only late term abortion  it's killing the baby after the baby is born  how about that  think of that  think of that  that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  and they're the party  frankly  of socialism  the republican party is the party of freedom  we're the party of the american worker  the american family  we're the party of the american dream  i'm fighting for you each and every day  i had a great life  i used to get great publicity  nobody got better窶ｦ i had such a great life  it was so easy  my great wife  the first lady  melania  she said  ""you know  you've always been a hard worker  you love to work  but your life was a lot easier in the old days "" but i love it and you know why i love it  because we're accomplishing so much  nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing  even a thing like right to try  right  right to try  they've been trying to get that for years and years and years  that's people that are really sick  terminally ill  they couldn't get medicine  we have the greatest doctors  the greatest clinics  the greatest technicians in the world  they couldn't get anything  they'd traveled to asia if they had money  they traveled to europe  they'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure  if they had no money they'd just go home  they'd die  they had no hope  for 44 years  they've been trying to get right to try  we are so advanced in medicine  we have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work  but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick  you know why  because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people  but the people were terminally ill  so i got it approved and it wasn't easy  it was complicated  the insurance companies didn't want to do it  the government didn't want to do it  the doctors didn't want to do it  tremendous liability  but our country didn't want to do it  they said  ""well  if it doesn't work  we're going to get sued "" i say  ""so they'll sign an agreement  very strong  one page  taking all liability away from the united states  from the drug companies  from the doctors  all liability  they're terminally ill  let's try it "" and you know what  it's been a miracle  so many people have done so well  it's great  we got it done  when i set about the agreement  they had these great lawyers and they said  ""gee  that's a good idea "" they'd been working in this few years  they said  ""that's a good idea "" i said  ""yeah  it's a good idea  how about getting you to me like in about two hours "" right to try  it's a great thing  but we have so many things like that  i have lists that you wouldn't even believe  i have lists that go on for pages of things we've done  we've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs  including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries  it's a very unfair system  our country pays the highest prices in the world  last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down  now we're going to bring it down by a lot  we're going to bring it down a lot  and now窶ｦ so other countries窶ｦ here's an example  canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do  so we have a great governor in the state of florida  ron desantis  calls me up  doing a great job  ron desantis  he was at three and he went to 70  that's a pretty good increase  right  ron desantis  a great governor  and he comes to me  he goes  ""you know  if you buy the drugs  if we buy the drugs  because this is so botched up  we have a middleman  it's not a good situation "" he said  ""if i could go and buy the drugs from canada  i could save 50% "" i said  ""do it  do it  and if you can buy them from europe  because their system窶ｦ"" like  remember i used to scream when i was winning states and not getting the delegates that i was entitled to and i'd say the system is rigged  well  the drug system is rigged  it's rigged  so if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from europe or from canada or from other places at a big deep discount  we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it  just happened today  and we're doing one other thing that  believe it or not is even bigger  but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks  with the help of your great senator  rob portman  we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in ohio  drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year  22%  no  but think of that  opioid  big problem  big problem  deaths went down  opioid deaths  22%  nobody writes that  nobody talks about that  they don't want to talk about that  good job  rob  good job  good job  mike  we passed va choice and va accountability on behalf of our great veterans  they been trying to pass va choice for four decades  they couldn't get it done  we got it done  we got it done  this is where a veteran would stand online for three  four  five  six days  for three weeks  for five weeks  sometimes they're okay  by the time they see a doctor  they're terminally ill  and i said  ""you know  i have a great idea "" because i not been doing that this long  you know  we've been working with this for窶ｦ i've been thinking about it a lot  this was during the campaign  what a campaign that was  right  was that a campaign or what  and i came back to my people  i had experts and i said  ""i have a great idea  these lines for the veterans are too long  it takes them three  four weeks sometimes to see a doctor  i have a great idea  let's let them go outside  go to a private doctor  we'll pay the bill  they'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately  we'll pay the bill "" and i thought窶ｦ i said  ""man  am i smart  i am the smartest guy to think of that "" so i went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and i said  ""how do you like that idea "" and they said  ""sir  we've known about it for about 40 years  but we've never been窶ｦ"" i said  ""really  you've known about it that long "" but here's the thing  we got it done  nobody else could get it done  nobody else  and accountability  you couldn't fire anybody  if they were treating our vets badly  you couldn't fire them for anything  people could steal  they could be sadistic to our vets  by the way  they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets  i can tell you that  they can be whatever they want  you couldn't fire them  and it was because of unions and it was because of other things  civil service  very tough  you couldn't fire anybody for almost anything  we had cases where people got窶ｦ they got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them  we got va accountability  now we say  ""jim  get the hell out of here  you're fired "" we're rebuilding our military  and after years of budget cuts and layoffs  the army tank plant in窶ｦ do you lima  you call it lima  right  see  you know  most people call it lima  but i know lima  but you know why  because i came here and they said  ""we're closing this plant "" i said  ""what kind of a plant is it "" remember when i was here  in lima  and i used to say  ""you mean lima "" they said  ""no  sir  it's lima "" that's why窶ｦ because  but leah  hey look  i'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter  okay  and i would have been in big trouble  but the good news is i don't use the teleprompter too much  if i did  you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal  but in lima  and i said  ""what kind of a plant "" and i said  ""let's go see it "" during the campaign i went to see it and they make the incredible  the best army tank in the world and i couldn't believe the complexity  the genius  i said  ""wait a minute  you close this  you'll never be able to open it again  you can't open this  this isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof  this is complicated  this is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here "" i said窶ｦ and i didn't know anything at the time other than i said  ""you're not closing it "" they took it off to list  they kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock  we're investing in the future of human space flight  americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to mars  it's going to be amazing  and you know  one thing i have to say also  and we're also winning the race to great  great strategic defense and offense  not just mars  and mike pence is doing a great job on that  great job  to protect america's security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible iran nuclear deal  a horrible  stupid deal  we gave iran  150 billion  we gave iran   1 8 billion in cash  plane loads of cash  i wonder what they saw when those planes landed  i wonder what happened to the cash  can you believe it  one  1 8 billion we gave them in cash  and remember what i said  iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago  when i took over  iran was all over  they had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction  they were all over  and now they just want to窶ｦ they want a negotiated deal so badly  iran  iran  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and just a few months ago  we recognized the golan

let's see what happens there  let's see what happens  tonight we renew our resolves that america will never be a socialist country  never  ever  ever will it be a socialist country  no matter what

5,20,Feb,2020,datasets/ColoradorSprings,"hello colorado  we love colorado  most beautiful place and i'm thrilled to be back in colorado springs  i've spent a lot of time here over the years  beautiful place  beneath the majestic peaks  that's true  of the rocky mountains with thousands of terrific  hardworking  great american patriots  with your help this november  we are going to defeat the radical democrats and we are going to win colorado in a landslide  and you're going to help us get cory gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%  there was no waiver  he's been with us  there was no waiver with corey  we appreciate it  thank you corey  thank you  this month we mark a very special anniversary  75 years ago this week our brave united states marines landed on the shores of iwo jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war  it was a rough one  tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the battle of iwo jima  james blaine  donald whipple and john thurman  great  great patriots  very brave people  just passed away  sadly he passed away just a few days ago  he was going to be here  passed away a few days ago  but he was great  i have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family  great  great gentlemen  so we were going to have four  we have three and we want to thank you for being here  thank you all  thank you  because america is truly a land of heroes  on behalf of the grateful nation i would like to recognize the many veterans of the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars who are here this evening  and a lot of them  great people  great people  this is a truly incredible time for america  we have the best economy in our history  the most prosperity of any country  we are doing better than any country in the world  that is not even close  and we've rebuilt our military over the last three years  don't tell anybody  but we spent two and a half trillion dollars  but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security  we don't worry about budgets  right  we don't worry about budgets  we had to rebuild it  it was depleted  it was in bad shape  it was old  it was tired  we have the best people in the world  but they had old equipment  now we have brand new jets  we have brand new missiles and rockets  we have everything all made in the usa  in my state of the union address  i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback  that's what we're doing  our country is stronger today than ever before  after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan democrat crusades  the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed  they have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today  just came out  and i don't know if anybody watched last night's debate  it got very big ratings and you know what  mini mike didn't do well last night  i was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what i do  is it  it's not easy  mike  not easy for any of them  now  mike didn't do too well  he went way down  it's all right  mini mike  how about klobuchar  did you see her  she choked  she choked  she couldn't breathe  alfred e  neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said  ""are you accusing me of being dumb "" who would make a statement like that  because that's really what he was doing  but he doesn't want to say that  no  how about that  ""are you saying i'm dumb "" that was the end of her campaign in my book  you don't say that  even if it's true  you don't say that  they had a crazy person on today on one of the fox shows  i tell you  fox doesn't treat us the way they used to  but we have the great sean hannity  we do  and we have laura and tucker  and we have in the morning fox and friends  steve and ainsley  and brian's gotten much better  he's moving up  and we have the great lou dobbs  lou dobbs says he's the greatest president ever  the great lou dobbs  he says  lou dobbs a year and a half  two years ago he said  ""he's the greatest since reagan "" then he said about six months ago  ""he's better than reagan "" and then he said a few nights ago  ""he's the greatest we've ever had "" i said  ""does that include lincoln and george washington "" he said  ""that includes them all "" that's lou dobbs  the great lou dobbs  and you've got hegseth and you've got jesse waters  how about jesse  and judge jeanine and even greg gutfeld  greg hated us  right  but now he says  ""look  whether i like him or not  he gets it done  it's all about getting it done "" we're getting it done  nobody's ever done what we've done  no  but fox says  and i don't know  it's different  it was different  in the old days  it was better for us  it was better for us  but it's okay  we'll win anyway  no  but they had this woman on  neil cavuto  doesn't treat us good  neil cavuto  he's not too good  she said  ""i don't like him "" nobody likes him  right now窶ｦ so you had  remember lest in the readies  you remember who was lest in the readies  he got fired  right  you remember  right  remember  he's gone and now neil's taking his place  neil is actually a nice guy  but he doesn't like trump too much  and he put this woman on today and she said  ""donald trump didn't do well in the debates and he won "" because she was referring to mike bloomberg  sometimes referred to as mini mike  and i said  ""wait a minute  i won every debate "" it's true  and we sent them polls  poll after poll after poll  not only won them  but won by a lot  i won every debate  i'm just saying every poll  they do those polls right after  three  four  500 000 people  time magazine  i said  ""nobody's allowed to do that  you can't do that "" we're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news  they make up 90% of the story  so where is dan scavino  where is scavino  does anyone know who dan scavino is  dan  bring me those pages up here  bring those pages up  see if you can get them  go get them  it's such fake news  it's so disgusting  you know what  they'd do better if they told the truth  do you agree  they'd do better  oh  someday in 10  14  18  22 years when i'm gone  when we leave office in 26 years or so  they're going to miss us  i told the story that a month before i ran  2016 i was thinking about it  i said to my wife  who has become a great first lady  people love here  they said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled  and i said  ""what the hell should i run for if they are so great "" but i remember holding up the new york times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain  a supermarket  right  it's like  the thing was blowing in the wind  it was dead and now it's successful again  but when we leave  it's all of us  we leave together  we're unified  this is the most unified the republican party has ever been  and when we leave  the new york times窶ｦ thank you  the great dan scavino  the most powerful man in politics  hey dan  so zuckerberg left  who is number one in the world on facebook  and i'm saying this in front of the fake news because if i'm wrong  they're going to report me  right  who is number one in the world on facebook  he walked in  but that's us  he walked in for窶ｦ we had dinner recently just because i want them to pay taxes  i want to find out what's going on  but he walked in  he's smart  and he said  ""i just want to congratulate you "" small dinner  a few people  he said  ""you're number one in the world in facebook "" i said  ""that's nice "" i said  ""who's number two "" he said  ""prime minister modi of india "" i said  ""wait a minute  wait a minute  he's got 1 5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one "" but we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country  for facebook  for twitter  for anything  and they still haven't figured it out  they have not figured it out  but look at all that press  look at all that press  did this ever happen before  and then you have brad pitt  i was never a big fan of his  he got upset  a little wise guy statement  a little wise guy  he's a little wise guy  anyway  but we're doing what  over here  i just showed this real quick  right  so this horrible journalist  she's a real  she's a trump hater  you know what she's worth  zero ratings  nobody watches her  but she said窶ｦ she was trying to窶ｦ look  bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night  he choked  he's another one who's going  "" oh i can't breathe  i can't breathe  don't ask me the question  please "" i look at my wife  i said  ""let's send him a little note  it's not so easy up there to do what i did  right "" not so easy  but this woman who is a third rate  fourth rate  she's been with everybody  every year she's with a different group  but i won't use her name because it'll make her too famous  it actually plays to their advantage  but she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at fox  neil cavuto  that's why  so she said  ""donald trump didn't get good ratings  he didn't do well in the polls "" she said  ""he didn't do well on the debates "" she said that we were defeated in the debates  well i defeated crooked hillary every time and by a lot  yeah  she's crooked as a  3 bill  i was going  ""whatever happened to the 33 000 emails  whatever happened "" 33 000  she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble  can you imagine if a republican did that  they would want to bring back the death penalty  right  two standards  but i think things are happening  i said drain the swamp  i just never knew how deep it was  we have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe  and this is part of the swamp  so what happens  she said  ""donald trump didn't do well in the debates "" now remember my answer  rosie o'donnell  right  first question i've ever  and we took down the house  then the second  brett barry asked me  i had to raise the hand  i'm the only one  i guess that raised the hand  right  and the place went crazy because i was the only one telling the truth  okay  turns out i was the only one telling窶ｦ and the people get it  but she said i didn't do well on the bench  i said  ""really  i won every single debate "" we had 15 to 14 debates  then we had the presidential debates with crooked hillary against myself  so here's one  i don't want to窶ｦ i'm a little guilty because these are all my friends  right  a lot of them are my friends now  they weren't my friends then  they were my mortal enemy  it's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody  you're right about that  so here's donald trump  67  the next one was 13%  the next one was 5%  4%  3%  2%  2%  2%  1%  1%  and 0  all right  that's time magazine  all right  that's time  they don't like me  i don't like them either  by the way  although actually i do like the new owner  this year i got beaten out by gretta  you know gretta  last year i got beaten out窶ｦ i mean  i've won it  but when the world evolves around all of us  we should be chosen  there's nothing wrong with it  right  i mean  we've won it  but we should win it every single year  let's face it  and now they call it person of the year  they don't go out man of the year  and i know the women out there are saying  ""isn't that nice "" but a lot of the women out there don't like it  they don't like it  we could have a woman of the year and a man of the year  i like that  okay  here's drudge report  drudge is starting to treat me good again  he started to like me again  i like him  look  trump and ted cruz  i can say he came in second  he was a great debater  and marco came in third and a guy who i don't like much and they don't like him much in ohio either  kasich  kasich  he was way down  way down  okay  look who won  trump  here's another one  look again  a different one  time magazine  trump  33%  ben carson  good man  he was down  marco  jed  ted  carly fiorina  a name i haven't heard in a long time  what happened to carly  and ran  good poll  here's the story  look  but way up  way up  look at this  here's another one  look at this  trump 46%  i didn't make this up  here's another one  this is a different debate  i don't know  they're all different  i won every one of them  look  trump  i just took these at random  46%  second  5%  3%  5%  3%  9%  5%  11%  trump  46%  here's another one  cnbc  well  the market's been up  they've actually been not so bad and joe kiernan is a good guy  he is a good guy  some of the rest  i don't care for it too much  becky's like  she plays it a little bit down in the middle  right  which is okay  trump  almost 50%  then they have all the rest of them  14  4  3  2  2 8  2 54  1 9  i'm not going to give you the names  i won't tell you that i got 48 8 and jeb bush got 1 1  the rest i'm not going to talk about  but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter  sort of a never trumper i guess  so jeb  1 9  1 1  and trump 48  that's another one  oh  here's a nice one  here's a nice one  look at this  look at this  trump 70%  next one is 18%  next one is 7  4  3  3  3  2  1  1  1  trump didn't do well in the debate  see  they're fake news  here's another one  trump kicked ass  trump kicked ass  trump 48  number two was six  here's another one  trump 75 6  crooked hillary was 24%  this was against crooked hillary  so look at that  trump was 74 6  crooked hillary clinton was 24 1  trump was 80%  crooked hillary was 18%  and i've got this woman  you know who it is  right  nobody knows the name  i'm not going to mention it  but everybody knows neil cavuto  she has no credibility and neither do you  neil cavuto  here's another one  crooked hillary  and by the way  one is a fox poll  one is breitbart  one is a drudge report  one is a patch  one is syracuse com  one is pollack opinion  alyssa goodwin  but look at these numbers  trump 92  what is it  so i'm winning every poll  i beat crooked hillary  here's the one  trump 61  crooked hillary 39  okay  that's what it is  and then i turn on the damn show on fox  again  it's not the same  it was much better  it really was  it was much better  i turn on fox and i've got this third rate political journalist  if you call her that saying  ""trump did very poorly in the debates  but he became president "" no  i did great in the debates  i became president because of the debates  because unlike mini mike  i could answer questions  and here's the final one and i could get you another 15  these are all the ones that taken right after  people call in  hundreds of thousands of people  they call in time magazine  cnbc  so here's a cnbc  crooked hillary clinton  39%  donald trump  61%  and then this stupid person said i didn't debate well  now look  i don't mind and you can have bad debates  but i won every single debate  listened to this  then three and a half  four years later i have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well  because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world  take it  take it  here it is  okay  let's get back to business  now i feel good  now i feel good  she's a third rate journalist  let's go  we're standing up in defense of our constitution  our freedom and democracy itself  right  while the extreme left has been wasting america's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes  we went through hoaxes  we went through the impeachment scam  and by the way  corey was with us all the way  he didn't move  he didn't budge  he said it's a lot of bull  he said it's a lot of bull  but while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud  we're working with these people  they want to take you out  they want to change the results  they got caught spying  let's say it like it is  right  they got caught spying on our election  fake news  hey fake news  take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you  go ahead  show them the room  show them the room  you see  they never do it  including fox  by the way  fox is not that much better  we just got lucky because we have some窶ｦ all their high rated shows are the shows that like trump  all their losers shows like cavuto are the shows that don't like trump  how is shep smith doing lately  by the way  how is shep smith  he had the lowest ratings and now cavuto took his place so that's okay  but they never show the room  my wife  a great first lady  she goes窶ｦ i say  ""hi honey  did you watch the debate "" ""yeah "" ""how did the room look  was that窶ｦ"" because last night i think we turned away 21 000 people  we had an arena that it held 12  but we fill up the basketball courts  right  or the ice rink  we had to have 15  16 000 people  it was on fire  you all saw it  it was great  and she said to me  she said  ""darling  how did you do "" i said  ""i did great "" i said  ""did you see the arena "" and she said  ""no  they never show the arena "" you know that guy dana white at ufc  i won't tell you about him yet  but he's a brilliant guy  right  i mean  he sold his crazy fighters  i mean bomb bomb bomb   4 billion he got with fertittas  great people  but you know what  they're always showing it's full  it's full  these fakers back there  they don't want people  but i'll tell you what my wife said  ""they don't show it  but you can't imitate 15 000 people when it comes to the noise "" look  they won't show it  they never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day i came down the escalator  not one  what these guys do if mr  and mrs  jones sitting right up there  beautiful couple  if she said  ""darling  i'm sorry  there's nothing i can do about it  darling  i have to go to the bathroom "" he said  ""darling  i'll walk with you "" the cameras glong on to those seats  they glong on and they say  ""there were two empty seats  trump didn't fill up the room "" these are the worst people  but when i told them to spin around those cameras  they stayed that way  now  if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena  it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people  those cameras that can do  they look like a pretzel  they look like a pretzel  they want to find it  there's trouble  those same guys could  it could cover anything  i used to think  well it's the equipment  it's very rigid  they can't turn it  and then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff  because that's dangerous in this room  to be honest  we don't have it too much  they only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters  but if somebody up there does something  those cameras turn around  spin around like a pretzel  they bend  boom  they get  so that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment  and by the way  i told them  turn around  not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news  while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with vial hoaxes  we've been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  enacting fair trade deals  securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  right  we added another 225 000 brand new beautiful jobs last month  way  way  way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be  225 000  think of it  we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country  almost 160 billion  00 in the morning  they are watching  the whole world was watching  that was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen  even espn  some guy on espn said  ""this is the most exciting event i've ever seen "" and all he does is watch sporting events and big ones  but since the election  7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than  2 trillion into that military that we talked about  and we created- into that military that we talked about  and we created something that's very exciting  and we have our great new general  he's on the 窶ｦ he's on our 窶ｦ i'll tell you  he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen  the sixth branch of the united states armed forces  the space force  and i will be making a big decision for the space force as to where it's going to be located  and i know you want it  we'll be making that decision toward the end of the year  i was here  i did your 窶ｦ i met 窶ｦ i was up at the air force academy  and i greeted those kids  they were so great  i did the commencement address  was anybody there  i did the commencement address  and the general said  sir  would you like to shake hands with the cadets  i said  does everyone else do it  president  oh  yes  sir  what he didn't say is  they'll shake 10 hands  i said  so they do 窶ｦ how many do you have  sir  we have 1156 cadets  i said  you mean other people do it  yes  sir  but they don't do 1156  they'll do 30  40  they'll take the top 10 out of the class  i said  i'll do it  i stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing  true  and i shook 1156 hands  and a lot of these kids are very strong physically  in fact  you have one of them as an example  he was the winner of the home run derby  did you know that  college 窶ｦ think of that  the college home run derby  i said  let me see you  i want to see what you look like  he stands up  uniform  everything else  and by the way  i did something for air force  but i did something for all of the academies  if you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting  although they've done well  if you're a great athlete  you can't 窶ｦ we wanted to get them to go  but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the nfl or baseball  so  i had one of the teams in  they said  sir  give us the waiver  sir  they've been after the waiver  you know what the waiver is  that means that if you're a great athlete  you can go to the air force academy  or army  navy  the coast guard  you can go to one of our service academies  i did the rule and we got it through congress  and you don't have to serve  you go directly into the major leagues and to the nfl  and you serve your time after  when you get out  isn't that great  and the army coach  who's a great guy 窶ｦ all great guys  navy coach  army coach  said sir  if you do that  we can compete with anybody  because we lost lot of great athletes who said  you know  we just can't do that  now they serve their time afterwards  isn't that great  and we did it  they've been trying to get that for so many years  but i love that group of people  i saw this guy from the home run derby  and i shook hands  oh  i shook hands  and they come up and they're strong people  and they're shaking  and they're excited  they're a little nervous  maybe  they're meeting the president  they're a little nervous  and they're strong  they've got big  strong hands  and they're saying 窶ｦ and i'm saying  hello  sir  thank you  man  jeez  what are you  i'm captain of my wrestling team  sir  i admire you greatly  sir  thank you  sir  it's like 窶ｦ and i'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt  by the end of the day  i'm going like 窶ｦ but we did it  and then i said  wait a minute  i said  general  no other president could do that  the presidents don't do that  he said  no  they do  sir  but they stop  usually  at around 50  oh  that's great  but i love the air force academy  and you have all of the infrastructure  so you're being very strongly considered for the space command  very strongly  and actually  i have to say this  i think i can say this  mr  senator  but the governor showed up at the plane today  your governor  democrat  no  but in all fairness  he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it  that's okay  that's all right  and we are going to be making that decision  cory  when we make that decision  all right  okay  but we've destroyed the isis territorial caliphate 100 percent  we killed the founded and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  he's dead  he's dead  and we just killed the world's number one terrorist  qasen soleimani  ending his evil reign of terror forever  forever and ever  he was the king of the roadside bomb  right  when you see these young men and in some cases women  no legs  no arms  they get it  and 92 percent of them were from soleimani  and then they started making them 窶ｦ they had great detection  we had these guys  great detection  then all of a sudden  the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal  so they're blowing the guys up with the scopes  so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic  real scum  but he's gone  he's evil  he's dead  and america is respected again like never before  but as we keep on winning  washington democrats keep on losing their minds  they've gone nuts  that's why millions of registered democrats  voters  people that were with the democrats for a long time  they're leaving their party to join our movement  they're joining our great republican party  we have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years  and don't believe stories  and don't believe polls  because the polls are worse than the stories  they give phony polls  00  the polls have closed 窶ｦ and you know they only announce if you're very 窶ｦ if you're really going to win by a lot  otherwise  it takes all night  the polls have closed in the great state of texas  donald trump has won the great state of texas  thank you  but they had alfred e  newman  buttigieg  little buttigieg  i said  i've had you up to here  they had little buttigieg leading donald trump in texas  these people  but very close  they said  it's too close to call  where buttigieg 窶ｦ so  a friend of mine from texas  a big  powerful  strong guy  real texas  he's got the cowboy hat 窶ｦ i'd love to wear that hat  i wouldn't have to comb my hair so much  i wouldn't need hairspray  right  i love those texas hats  i don't know if we'd get away with it in washington  that's my only problem  but i love them  this guy wears that big hat  the biggest hat  he's a big guy  and he's interviewed by somebody  he said  listen  i don't know much about politics  but i can tell you one thing  buttigieg is not tied with the president  the president is leading him by 20 points  it's like i said the last time  nobody's leading trump in texas  and you know what  nobody is even close to us in the great state of colorado  we're leading big  nobody  with your energy and enthusiasm  this november  and specifically it's november 3rd is the big day  and this is going to be as big 窶ｦ and i can't say bigger  because what was bigger than that  they came from the hills  they came from the mountains  they came out of the rivers  they came all over the place  great people  they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for  women would come in  they hadn't voted in 20 years  great women  beautiful women  strong women  smart women  wives  no  no  incredible  and they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're 窶ｦ we're the elite  just so you 窶ｦ they're not the elite  we're the elite  and you know what  they'd show up  they've got trump bandanas along with our great vice president mike pence  trump pence  and they got the hats now and they walk 窶ｦ these are people that were never political people  they never wore a pin  now they've got 30 pins all over their chest  they've got the hats with the things and the trump  and nobody's ever seen anything like it  really  it's a great revolution  and we're turning this country around  and i'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016  but i think if we don't do it  a lot of what we've done  and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability  but you know what  they can undo it  but in four years they can't undo it  because that tree will be planted  it will be solid  they're not going to be able to do it  so we've got to win  and your second amendment is at stake  remember that  so this november  we're going to take back the house  we're going to hold the senate  and we are going to keep the white house  so we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country  and i want to thank mike pence  i heard he gave a great speech  i never want it to be too good  i never want it to be too good  i said  mike  take it easy  can't be too got  mike is great  but we have

tonight by somebody that you really love  and i love him  too  but there's a reason  he's my son  don junior  and kimberly guilfoyle  kimberly  thank you  kimberly  and a man 窶ｦ he happens to own the chicago cubs  but that's okay  he's done an incredible job  actually  he had a five year plan on the fifth year  the stadium was fully rebuilt  and they won the world series  that's not bad  he had a five year plan  rnc finance chairman todd ricketts  come on up  todd  come on up  come on up  todd  and i mentioned him a little earlier  but you didn't know he was here  i just said he's a champion  he's a winner  he's been a friend of mine for a long time  he's a tough cookie  he's the kind of people that made our country great  truly  they've made our country great  he started off with two people fighting each other  then he got four people fighting each other  then he got them fighting each other  each other  then he got six and eight and 12  all of a sudden people started watching and looking  and i was proud to hold his first event  that's why he loves me  they didn't want 窶ｦ they said  it's too dangerous  nobody would take it  i'm the only who said  take it  we'll take it  and it was unbelievable  i went and i said  this is great  let's do it again  and he has been my friend for a long time  and they put together a phenomenal deal  it's called ufc  he's the ufc president  and they just sold the company  he started it off for about   30  and they just sold it for  4 billion  and the people that bought it said  we're not buying it unless dana white stays back and runs it  so dana white  come on up  he's now a very wealthy guy  come here  you want to hear from him  yes  what's up  colorado  how are you today  so  i'm not a very political person  i'll start there  but let me say this  there's things that i can tell you about the president of the united states that you don't hear on t v  and you don't hear from other people  like you said  i've known this man for 20 years  we've actually become even closer since he's become the president of the united states  when somebody becomes the president of the united states  you don't ever expect to hear from them again  and i understand it  it absolutely makes sense  this guy is so loyal and such a good friend  every time i see him 窶ｦ i saw him today  when i met him on air force one  the first thing he said to me is  how is your family  how is your family  good man  very loyal  and a very good friend  i see a lot of things from mr  trump that the public doesn't see  and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend  and other people he's friends with  he's a fighter  he loves this country  he's doing great things for this country  and we got to win this election again  ladies and gentlemen  thank you  that was beautiful  because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time  right  politicians  what a job he does  and we thank you very much  dana  and you are my great friend  and thank you  but with cory and with me  they're not going to play with your second amendment  not going to happen  but it's 窶ｦ it is under siege  you see what's happening  but somebody 窶ｦ we fight together  and he's been so great  cory gardner  please come on up  please  thank you  that's beautiful  that's true of the pipeline  a long time they've been trying  we got it right away  and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year  cory is a champion for the people of colorado  he loves your state  look  he loves your state  he was here  he does the tractor thing  he loves tractors  he sells a certain type  and don't worry  if there's any noise  just let them 窶ｦ they won't hear us  and he's got my complete and total support and endorsement  he will never let you down  the unemployment rate among african-americans  hispanic-americans  and asian-americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded  and for women  71 years  and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number  71 years  the best numbers in 71 years  african-american and hispanic-american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded  the unemployment rate for women is going 窶ｦ and i'm telling you  within a very short period of time  you're going to see some statistics coming out on 窶ｦ statistics  i've got to do it right  otherwise they'll say  what's wrong  if you go 16 of these  and if you mispronounce one word  they say  what's wrong  statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable  they're going to be unbelievable  the best ever  the veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low  workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in u s  history  half a million more hispanic-americans now own a home  we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare  and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country  think of that  think of this  to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with tim scott great guy  great senator from south carolina  opportunity zones  jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in colorado  you know about that  right  it's been amazing  opportunity zones are amazing  what's happened  we're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it  reducing the cost of child care  and giving 40 million american families an average of  2 200 in their pockets directly thanks to the republican child tax credit  people don't know that  our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of washington bureaucrats  we repealed the ridiculous waters of the united states rule  which was basically taking away your property  and we are taking the bureau of land management out of washington  dc  we're just on it  and thank you very much secretary bernhardt  just up here  nice  slim  beautiful looking man  he looks beautiful  when you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done  and you're moving it and it's headquarters to grand junction  colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great american west should live right here in the great american west  and we have ended the war on american energy  it was a war  and we're up here and we're doing it  we are right now energy independent  can you believe it  they want to use wind  wind  wind  blow wind  please  please blow  please keep the birds away from those windmills  please  tell those beautiful bald eagles  oh  a bald eagle  you know  if you shoot a bald eagle  they put you in jail for a long time  but the windmills knock them out like crazy  it's true  and i think they have a rule  after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year  do you believe this  do you believe this  and they're all made in china and in germany  siemans  and for those of you that want to hear it  when they're making them  more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone  the atmosphere  more stuff is going up there  they're making it  ay  ay  ay  and they don't say this  but after a period of time they get tired  they get old  they get rusty  and a lot of the guys say  hey  their useful life is gone  let's get the hell out of here  and they're all over the place  you look at palm springs  california  take a look  palm springs  they're all over the place  they're closed  they're rotting  they look like hell  every major democrat running for president wants to entirely eliminate american production of oil and natural gas  crushing colorado's economy  destroying tens of thousands of colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state  they're doing that  look  you're going to vote for one of these people  probably crazy bernie  he seems to be leading  mini mike  i thought he might come up  but he can't because he can't debate  he wasn't meant for the camera  do we agree  he wasn't exactly great last night  no  i think he lost too last night  only in colorado could somebody say that  no  you're going to probably 窶ｦ it looks like bernie  doesn't it  it looks like crazy bernie  crazy bernie's not big into natural gas and oil  and the things that keep our great factories and plants going  but colorado voters will never let it happen  we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies  america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto  but under this administration  all of that is changing  the era of economic surrender is over  thank you  it's over  last month  we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new u s-mexico-canada agreement into law  incredible deal  the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers  ranchers  and manufacturers all across the great state of colorado and every other state  also  something we got that people don't talk about  if you love your children  you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses  if you love your children  it's great  and if you don't love your children  don't worry about it  who in the hell knows  if you don't love them  don't leave that beautiful farm to your children  give it to somebody else  okay  if they don't treat you well  give don't leave them a damn thing  are you listening  donnie  are you listening  donnie  i also took 窶ｦ no  it is true  that's a big deal  farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their 窶ｦ people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth  you couldn't do it  they'd go out 窶ｦ your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money  they'd end up losing their business  losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years  you know what happens  and they're good kids  and maybe they'll never be you  they can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can  maybe they're better  but you know what  they'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm  the numbers are staggering  we got rid of it  no more death tax  no more inheritance tax  and i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs  what they've done to us over the years  we were losing 200 billion  300  400  500  not million  billion  billion  not million  500 million would be a lot  we're talking about 500 billion  they were taking it  our strategy worked  we put tariffs up  25 percent on the first 250 billion  billions of dollars poured into the united states  they devalued their currency and they pumped money in  we didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys 窶ｦ they like to say they did  we didn't pay for it  and i'll tell you what  china- they like to say they did  we didn't pay for it  i'll tell you what  china came to the table  and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them  last month  as you know  we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defend our workers  protect our intellectual property  and boost american exports  250 billion worth of purchases   50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase   50 billion  you know the most they ever purchased were  16 billion  you know that story  i've told it a couple of times   16 billion was the most ever  secretary sonny purdue agriculture  he's done a great job  i said  ""who's the most  what's the biggest year "" "" 16 billion  sir "" i said  ""all right  make it 20 "" so they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal  biggest trade deal ever made  biggest deal ever made  we're getting ready to close the deal between that and usmca  we're getting ready to close it  i go over  i say  ""what do you have down for the farmers  they've been great "" although i have been helping you out  i gave you a lot of money  i gave you a lot of money   16 billion on year   12 billion from the year before  i took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover  but think of it  but i said  ""so tell me fellas  let me ask you  what do we have  what's the number "" "" 20 billion  sir "" they're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products  i said  ""make it 50  tell them to make it 50 "" so  we went to china and they were great  you know they got 1 5 billion people  you got a lot of feeding to do  i said  ""do me a favor  instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers  would you make it 50 "" ""no  no  no  no  no "" and they agreed to do it  they agreed to it  i don't think you're going to be able to make it  you better be able to make it  i don't want the farmers coming to me  sir  sir  i'm sorry we can't produce that much  sir  i said  ""our farmers will find a way  they'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land "" go out and buy a bigger tractor or something  no  but it is true  i've had people say  ""sir  they can't produce that much "" i said  ""forget it "" they will  look at them  you're a farmer  they'll figure that one out  although mike bloomberg said you'll never figure it out  they'll figure it out long before him  you'll figure that one out long before him  no  i know the farmers  i'm not worried about it   50 billion on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than on immigration  every day democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives  this region alone  last year ice officers arrested over 2000  and by the way  our ice officers  these guys are tough and they're brave  over 2000 criminal aliens  that's ms-13 gangs  thousands  and they bring them back to where they came from  by the way  now their countries take them back  they weren't taking them back  safe third agreements  they take them back  charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery  rape  and murder  we bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back  we have to put them  i don't want to house them for the next 50 years  but you know what  we don't want to take chances either  but we'll bring them back to guatemala  honduras  el salvador  mexico  we bring them back  they didn't use to take them  they said  ""we don't want them back  oh  okay  we'll keep them ourselves "" we don't do that anymore  in denver  an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times  attempting to murder him his own home  the alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years  other than that  he was a very fine fellow  for crimes including assault and child abuse  yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country  in communities across the nation  radical  and we're watching them very closely  left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities  and sanctuary states  and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities  last year  colorado democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals  as a result of state and local sanctuary policies  officials in boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community  in denver  officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges  and now he is a very dangerous man  we just caught him for attempted murder  right here in colorado springs  el paso county officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery  assault  and kidnapping  they released him straight into your community  these are the democrats  these are your democrats  democrats think that colorado should be a haven for murderers  predators  kidnappers  and felons in our country and that come in illegally  republicans believe that colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans  not criminal aliens  if you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states  if you want to protect your family and your loved ones  you must vote for cory  vote for trump  vote for the republican party  we're getting it done  thank you  thank you very much  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row  illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring  and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release  you know what you do  you catch him  you say  ""where do you live "" they don't live here  they don't have an address  ""where do you live  give us your address "" they don't have an address  many are criminals  many are very dangerous criminals  so they're saying  and we are building the wall  it's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday  it's a serious wall  did you hear  two weeks ago  a small section  twice the size of this stage  we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete  and a lot of  it's mexico  it's very rough territory  some of it  it's partially desert  we were in a rough area  very windy  and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm  so we hadn't put it in  we put it in and it was just getting set  and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down  and the fake news said trump's wall fell down  it was blown down  but see  at least we have a voice where we can explain  it's true  we lifted it up and we held it up  when the storm went by  we had it set and it's set beautifully  and the following day  that sucker is going to be up for many  many years  can you imagine  i said what happened in a certain area  and we're doing a great job by the way  in new mexico  new mexico is going to be a great  great state for the republican party  and arizona  what we're doing on the border in arizona  they want us to do it badly  but can you imagine that  a thing falls over because the concrete was just poured  it's soaking wet and it falls over  and they make it sound like the wall fell down  these are very  very dishonest people  but you know that  border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded  it's horrible what's happening  the largest amount ever recorded  we've deported record numbers of gang members  especially the ms-13 gang members  but there are others that are just as bad  we've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country  the border is going to be very soon secured  we'll have  some time next year  over 500 miles of beautiful  powerful wall built  washington democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy bernie sanders  132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million americans of their great private coverage that you want  while the socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare  and trying to destroy your social security  that won't happen with me  my administration is protecting your social security  your medicare  and is fighting to give you great  great healthcare  already done a good job  we're defending your right to keep the doctor  and to keep the plan of your choice  remember  president obama 28 times  he said  ""keep your doctor  keep your plan  keep your doctor  keep your plan  keep your doctor  keep your plan "" right  it was a lie  we should impeach him  we should impeach him  impeach obama  get him out of office  no  nobody thought of that  we caught him in a lie 28 times at least  he's on record  we caught him in a lie  but nobody said let's impeach him  only these maniacs  crazy nancy pelosi  crying chuck schumer  what about the little pencil neck  right  pencil neck  he's got the world's smallest neck  here's a guy that lied about my statement  he made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract  he made up a statement  it was totally fiction  he made it up and then they tell me  you're getting ready to sue him  and they say  ""oh no  he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of congress "" that should be worse  no  that should worse  little wise guy  we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office  we're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better  they're better  we're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will  we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing  i signed an executive order imposing price transparency  that's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way  watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices  those same prices fall very  very fast  we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs  which are just as good as the name brand drugs  but at a tiny fraction of the cost  we have totally transform veteran's health care  including getting the long sought va choice and va accountability  so  now if our veterans have to wait in line  they go out to a doctor  a local doctor  we pay the bill and they're all set  they don't have to wait for six weeks  he's agreeing  right  good  right  you don't see those stories  you used to see all these horrible vet stores  veterans  the veterans on television  and you don't see it because veterans choice  it's amazing  our great veterans  here's a man right here  you're saying  yes  purple heart  thank you  thank you  that's great  but it's a lot different under trump  isn't it  a lot different under trump  and now you go out to a private doctor  but you know  we also got accountability  they've been trying to get these things done for 45  46  48 years  couldn't get them done  i'm good at getting things approved  i have to say  but  we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets  if somebody isn't doing a good job  you couldn't fire him  now you look at him  you say  ""get the hell out of here  you're fired "" we passed another thing  for 44 years  they've been trying to get it passed  the spectacular right to try  where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick  we can use it and we are having tremendous results  right to try  i hope that nobody in this room needs it  i hope you don't need it  but if you do  we have the best in the world  and we're seeing amazing results  we're combating the opioid epidemic  drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years  we are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing  all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the very moment of birth  you know that  that is why at my state of the union  i asked congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  the democrat party is the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  blatant corruption  and the total obliteration of your second amendment  that's what it is  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and the late great abraham lincoln  people forget that  people forget honest abe  he's the most presidential guy  i've always said i could be more presidential than anybody  but i'm not sure i can beat honest abe when he wears the hat  that hat is too much  it's so easy to be presidential  so easy  it's so much easier than doing what i have to do  but you know what i'd have  i'd have about three people in the front row  how about sleepy joe  how about his performance  what  what  it's great to be with the great people of ohio  joe  joe  you're in iowa  you're an iowa  oh  wow  he did it five times  so far  i've never done it  thank you  i've never done it  if i do it  that's a bad sign  now he does it all the time  he was in new hampshire and he said he was in vermont  it's great to be in vermont  joe  you're in new hampshire  dammit  he'd go up and tell him again and again  joe  what the hell is wrong with you  joe  sleepy joe  he's sleepy joe  he was sleepy a long time ago  but now he's really sleeping  but it's easy to be presidential  you know that  the easiest thing you could do is presidential  never open your jacket  never  it's got to be buttoned up  right  ladies and gentleman  the president of the united states  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you very much  it's so great to be with the people of colorado  thank you  everybody  good night  good night  no  no  it's so easy  it's so easy  honestly  look  i did very well with the state of the union  right  they said it was one of the best  smart  smart  smart guy  we do good  we're representing you  i better do good  if i didn't do good  you'd dump me so fast  actually  i don't think you would dump be so fast  actually  you want to know the thing  she said  ""we're never dumping you "" fake news cnn went up to a woman  ""what does it take for you to leave the president "" ""i'm not leaving him "" there were 10 women  and the one woman  beautiful  incredible women  and they had their bandanas  they had hats  trump  and stupid cnn  they go up  ""what does it take for you "" then he goes  ""look  he said one time that his people are so good  they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue "" do you remember  right  "" would you stay if he shot somebody "" this is actually an answer  or something to the effect  ""would you say every shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue "" the woman looks  ""well  it depends why he shot him "" makes sense  depends why he shot him  but then they said  ""we're not leaving him  we're never leaving him "" we're in thing together  folks  we got the swamp  we got that dirty  rotten swamp  we got crooked politicians  we got a lot of bad people  but we're getting them out one by one  we better be  little adam schiff  that little adam schiff  what a crooked politician  he's a corrupt politician  talking about guys  he'll lie and then the next day get caught  he'll be sorry that he got caught  the next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing  he's got no shame  he's got no shame  he's a liar  i think he's a sick person  republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background  every community  and every walk of life  you know that we're the party of boundless optimism  excitement  energy and enthusiasm  we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement  we are the big tent  we are the big party  we have the big ideas for the future  republicans are fighting for school choice  big deal  it's a big deal  because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school  to uphold the new rule of law  we have confirmed 217 brand new  beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written  that's a record  that is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime  so  think of it  if they're 40 years old  if they're 45 years old  they can be there for 40  50 years  as you know  and by the way  that's a record by a lot  i have the record  but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record  who has the percentage  do you know  george washington  100%  but it was only 16 people  so  with 217  can you imagine that  it's a record and we're going up  we're going up  the democrats are thrilled about that one  and as you know  i have nominated and we have confirmed two great new supreme court justices  colorado zone  right  colorado  that's right  colorado zone  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  neil gorsuch  that's right  colorado  he's a great guy  too  great guy  colorado  that's a big thing  that's another great check you have down for count  neil gorsuch  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  they said they were going to do it for years  we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  our investments in the united states military include more than  300 million this year  has anyone ever heard of a place called fort carson  another place  peterson air force base  you know that  another place  the air force academy  you know that  and schriever  right  air force base schriever  schriever  was that right  schriever  right  schriever  that's a little tricky one  it took me a little while  i'm looking at that sucker  i'm saying  ""schriever  right "" thank you  that's very nice  he saw he was having a little trouble with that one  that's tricky  you don't like to mispronounce a word  you come to a great place like this and instead of calling it fort carson  you go at fort crasson  and they say  ""oh  this guy doesn't know anything about us "" no  a lot of money going into fort carson  it's great  for years  you watched as your politicians apologize for america  you saw that  well  i'd like to apologize  we don't apologize  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of colorado  at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for  they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020  november 3rd  only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  we'll get it finished  we'll get it finished  they're bad people  they're all over the place  they're bad people  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  you know that  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane and lawful system of immigration  we will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing  i'm going to india next week and we're talking trade  they've been hitting us very hard for many  many years  but i really like prime minister modi  we got to talk a little  we've got to talk a little business  they've been hitting us hard  they give us tariffs  one of the highest in the world is india  but i hear they're going to have 10 million people  they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world  the largest cricket stadium in the world  which is brand new and beautiful  but you know what  and the only problem with doing that  prime minister modi said  ""we will have 10 million people greet you "" here's my problem  we have a packed house  we have a lot of people  thousands of people that couldn't get in  it's going to look like peanuts from now on  i'll never be satisfied with the crowd  if we have 10 million people in india  how can i be satisfied if we fill up a 60 000 seat stadium  big deal  see  i'm getting spoiled  he said  ""build a bigger stadium "" that's good  colorado  very good  but it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa  that beautiful phrase  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer  they've made such progress  and ending the aids epidemic in america  we started a year ago  it should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then  they didn't start it  but we're starting it  we'll have it done within nine years  it's a 10 year process  think of that  aids  we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on mars  you have a lot of that action happening right here  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  that's a big one  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one  beautiful america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy  are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  we live by the words of our national motto  in god we trust  from pueblo to fort collins  from denver to durango  from black forest to broomfield  from castle rock to right here in colorado springs  we stand on the shoulders of red blooded american patriots who poured out their heart  and sweat  and soul  to secure our liberty and defend our freedom  colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors  cowboys and miners  and ranchers who tamed the wilderness  explored the west  scaled the rockies  fought the battles  and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth  and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before  proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion  and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning

6,17,Oct,2019,datasets/Dallas,"thank you  thank you very much  hello dallas  it's great to be with you tonight  thank you  i am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of texas where we just opened a beautiful new louie vuitton plant  i'm with the freedom loving patriots of the lone star state  i love it  there has never been a better time to be a proud texan and there's never a better time to be a proud american  there never has  never has  i came from a small town  alvarado  texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of american manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places  i'll tell you  this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for texas  since my election  we've created 775 000 new jobs across your state including 70 000 texas manufacturing jobs  they said those jobs had disappeared  didn't they  huh  hey man  our country is once again living by two simple rules  buy american and hire american  the economy is booming  our people are prospering  our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before  but the more america achieves  the more hateful and enraged these crazy democrats become  crazy  they're crazy  they're crazy  at stake in this fight is their survival of american democracy itself  don't kid yourself  that's what they want  they are destroying this country but we will never let it happen  not even close  for three straight years  radical democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great  great election  maybe  maybe the greatest election in the history of our country  they want to oppose an extreme agenda  they cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box  they're not going to win  the not even going to get 窶ｦ they won't come close in 2020  they know it  they know it  they're not going to win it  they say  let's see  what's another idea  what's another idea  how do we win this election  you know  i really don't believe anymore that they love our country  i don't believe it  crazy nancy  think of that  that crazy nancy  she is crazy  and shifty schiff  how about this guy  he makes up my conversation  which was perfect  he makes up my conversation  he sees what i said  it doesn't play well because it was perfect  so he made up a totally false conversation with the ukrainian president and we caught him cold  everybody knew it anyway  see  we did one thing  you always have to do the unexpected  they never thought i'd released the conversation with the ukrainian president  i want to get him before congress and i want to see what he has to say  you know  they say he has immunity  why would you have immunity for outright fraud  why do you have immunity  why  he's a fraud  we're fighting a campaign against leftist  socialist  and globalists who want to return to reckless wars  open borders  rampant crime  and totally disastrous one way trade deals  we're changing that one around very quickly  they believe america is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy  military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own  it's not happening anymore  our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens  and you know that's what's been happening  and that's why 2016 was so important  and that's why 2020  i can never say it's more important  but you know it's like the roots of a tree  you plant the baby tree  it's got to catch  get that extra time  we'll have more tax cuts  we'll have even 窶ｦ i'll tell you what  we have rebuilt our military  what we've done has never been done before  the do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over  we are finally again  and we've been doing it now for almost three years  can you believe we've been doing this for three years  can you believe it  i've been a politician for three years  i can't believe that  i never thought i'd be called a politician  i don't like it  but it is what it is  but we're finally again putting america first  the radical democrats want to destroy america as we know it  they want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that america is a sinful  wicked nation  you see that happening all the time  and i know it from personal experience  what they want to teach your kids  not good  they come home  mommy  daddy  this is what i learned  and you're going  oh no  don't tell me  let's get them into another school fast  they want to disarm law abiding citizens  they want to take your guns away  they want to install far left judges to shred our constitution  it's not happening  they want to tear down symbols of faith and drive christians and religious believers from the public square  they want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor  muzzle  and shut down conservative voices  you know that  if they didn't hate our country  they wouldn't be doing this to our country  they wouldn't be doing it because they know better  they know better  as an example  we're building a great wall along the southern border and it's going up rapidly  going up  and you know  five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until i came along and i said  we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done  then they stopped the funding  they made it almost impossible  few people would've been able to do what we did  but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we're building that sucker right now and it's having a tremendous effect already  not easy  highest level  everything we said it would be  it's moving rapidly  although the fake news back there  they don't want to talk about it  they don't want to talk about it  look at all those cameras  you believe it  look at all those red lights  don't worry  i won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times i get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know  you see those red lights go off  off  off  off  they don't want their viewers to see it  but that's okay  i'm not going to say it tonight  i'm going to say you're legitimate media  i don't actually mean that  but you look at that  but look at all those cameras  you know that's like the academy awards used to be before it failed  you know why it failed  you know why it failed  because they came after us  that's why it failed  it failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us  stupid  stupid people  they are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket  i love seeing it  i'm telling you  love it  but no matter how hard they try  they will fail because the people of texas and the people of america will never surrender our freedom to those people right there  we will stand strong for family  faith  god  and for country  last week  a very dumb democrat candidate for president  that's the end of him in this state  pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities  by the way  that was after a few weeks ago  he said  excuse me  we're going to take your guns away  that doesn't work well with me  i called him right  remember the flailing arms  nobody noticed it  i noticed it  the flailer  you remember he was flailing all over the place  i said why is this guy hot  john cornyn's going to win so easily  just like ted cruz won  he's going to win no matter what happens  but john cornyn is not talking about beto anymore because beto  in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion  those are not two good things in texas to get rid of  i will never allow the federal government to be used to punish americans for their religious beliefs  i will never allow the irs to be used as a political weapon  except in the case of myself where they use it against me  the radical left tolerates no dissent  it permits no opposition  it accepts no compromise  these people are crazy  and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people  first it was the russia hoax  then it was the smearing which continues  that disgraceful  disgusting smearing of a fine man  justice kavanaugh  and now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing  with nothing  they come after me  but what they're really doing is they're coming after the republican party and what they're really  really doing is they're coming after and fighting you  and we never lose  i'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values  traditions  and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world  and i have to say this  we are far greater now than ever before  you go back four years  you go back seven  six  eight  even you go back into another administration  you go back 10 and 12 years  where were you compared to where you are right now  we must hold the democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption  they are corrupt people  and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up  it's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide  today's do nothing democrats  they don't do anything  where's the usmca  everybody wants it  the democrats even want it and crazy nancy won't let anybody vote on it  she's nuts  today's democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed  it's not just like  let's win  you know  i have to say this  the republicans said  i'm not sure i like this because my life hasn't been this way  but the republicans play a much softer game  they really do  when all of our stars  and we have great stars  when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas  oh  let's take it easy  let's 窶ｦ okay  i mean  i get that too  she hands them out like it's cookies  here  subpoena  i heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day  doesn't like us at all  but said  i've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas  i have people getting subpoenas i never heard of  i said  who are those people  never saw anything like it  it's a disgrace what they're doing to our country  we became  because of what they do  not the republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see  when people come to my office  which is now the oval office  which is your office too  presidents  prime ministers  kings  queens  i hate to say it  sometimes dictators  they just don't like to go by that title  they say  sir  congratulations sir on what you've done  congratulations on what you've done  it's incredible  your economy is the greatest on earth  and let me tell you it  if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now china would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world  we've gone up trillions of dollars  they've gone down trillions of dollars  and we are so far number one  so far that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here  but the do nothing democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed  they don't want to just beat them  they don't want to just beat him  these are sick people  they want to crush these people  the anger  the hatred  and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so schiff gets up and makes up my statement  he makes it up 100% and then he said he didn't speak to the whistle blower  no  we didn't see the whistleblower  and what about the whistleblower  the whistleblower got it all wrong  who's the whistleblower  who's the whistleblower  who is the whistleblower  we have to know  is the whistleblower a spy  and who is the ig that did this  all he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down  the transcribed version of the phone call  compare that to the whistle blower's account and you see it had nothing to do with it  so why does the ig allow a thing like this to happen to our country  why  why  got a lot of bad people out there  but one by one we're advancing  one by one  just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the bidens  i hate to talk about him  you know why  i don't think the guy's got a chance  sleepy joe  i don't think he's got it  i don't see it  i don't know  i've got these great  brilliant senators over here  i have all these congressmen over here  fellows i don't think he has a chance  i'd like him to  i'd like him to  you know i thought pocahontas was gone  left in embers  you got to give her credit  those embers  they kept going  going  going  now it looks like she's doing better  but i don't think joe has a chance  but did you see the other night where cnn  in a totally unsubstantiated statement  the president said this about you  we're so sorry he said that  his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china  these were not the same chinese people i just dealt with  i will tell you that  but joe biden was in charge of ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the navy like a dog  was paid massive sums of money by a ukrainian energy company  you know that's called  it's called a payoff  folks  he didn't no energy at all  knew nothing about energy  they hired him  paying him massive amounts of money  much more than the  50 000 a month you heard about  that's a lot  that's a lot  but much more  joe biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape  but they don't want to show the tape  i had to put it up on my social media site  they don't want to show the tape where he was bragging  you're not going to get this money unless they get rid of 窶ｦ and boom  they got rid of the prosecutor  he was investigating the son and the son's company  got rid of him  now that's what you call quid pro quo  while these charges are totally unsubstantiated  these are the fake newsers out there  and then biden flew  think of it  he goes into a tough place  we just met such a great deal with china  just think of this  my guy said  if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product  that would be good  the most china ever did was 16 billion for our farmers  okay  we're just talking about the farmers  we did banking  we did everything  but we're talking about them  the most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers  our great farmers  our patriot farmers  our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by china  they never left me  so they wanted 20 in china agreed  i said  nope  no good  i want 50 billion  not 20 billion  50  so my guys say  sir  we have a problem  sir  our farmers cannot produce that much  it's true  i said  tell them to go out and get bigger tractors  right  john deere case  caterpillar  all american  only american tractors  we only buy american tractors  go out and get bigger  so now china's agreed  they've already started buying  hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president xi and others in chile  that's in about four weeks  but they give this  they said  sir  they can't produce  50 billion  i said  i want the farmers to tell me 窶ｦ remember the story about winning  we're going to win so much  we're going into the white house  we're going to tell the president  sir  we just can't stand winning  the state of texas  john cornyn and ted cruz  they're going to come into my office  sir  we just can't stand this winning in texas anymore  it's too much  we can't handle it  well  that's what i want from the farmers  i want the farmers to say  i want the farmers to say  sir  we just can't produce that much product  we can't do it  sir  and i'm going to say yes  you can  and they're going to say  no  we can't  i'm going to say yes you can  and they're going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from china as opposed to 20  that's what's going to happen  that's what's going to happen  but they were great  they stuck with us through thick and thin  now it's really working out for a lot of different groups  in the meantime we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and china's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out  tens of billions of dollars  it's cost us nothing  billions and billions and billions  you know what i did for the farmer  during the lean times  i gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before   28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that i had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained  you know our farmers didn't want that money  our farmers didn't want it  true story  everybody comes for money  countries come for 窶ｦ everybody wants money  right  they all want our money  the farmers said  sir  we don't want this money  it's a subsidy  we don't want it  i said  no  it's not a subsidy  you're being targeted unfairly  they said  no  sir  it's a subsidy  this is true  i had 35 farmers in the oval office  incredible people  they didn't want it  they said  sir  just give us a level field  so now i gave them a field that's more than level  it's level like this  nice and easy  nice and easy  but the farmers  i call them the great patriots the farmers  i never lost them  they always said  yeah  i'm in trouble  i got a problem  but this should have been done many  many years ago by other presidents and other leaders  and we lose for many years  500 billion a year with china and many other countries we lose billions  we lose with everybody  but that's all changing now  but we lose 500 billion  not million  500 millions is a lot  right  we lose 500 billion  and you know what  it's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years  it was a disgrace  disgrace  but now we're taking in billions of dollars  they've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had  so that's good  that's good  so biden flew with hunter on air force 2  they flew to china  hunter walked out of the plane  had a quick meeting  walked away with one and a half billion dollars  these characters back there said  oh  that's okay  there's no problem  can you imagine if don or eric trump or ivanka trump  who's here someplace 窶ｦ right here  and by the way  our great first lady is home watching this  she said  this is the most exciting thing i've seen in a long time  you're a great first lady  doing a great job  she's doing a great job  we're doing a great job  the whole country now is doing a great job  so biden takes 1 500 000 000 and he goes on and he allows china to rip us off  remember he said a year ago  no  no  china's good  they've done nothing wrong  they are wonderful people  they are all wonderful people  i don't blame china  by the way  i blame our leaders for allowing this horrible  you know what and pillage  it's the r word  you know what and pillage  you know what word i'm talking about  right  i don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that trump used  so the biden's got rich while america got robbed  tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the democrats  they're so deep seeded  they never pay the price  they never pay  but maybe soon that will start  you know  we've had a lot of  we've had a lot of obama people and clinton people and some  to be honest with you  we've had some pretty bad republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us  but slowly they're getting out  they have all sorts of protections  he says get rid of them  yeah  we're trying  get rid of them  but their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media  that's the problem  because the democrats and the fake news media  it's a partnership  remember that  and you see it all the time  and i've never seen it to this extent  you know  when i won in the primaries and then i won the election  i was treated horribly by the media  horribly  and then when i won the election  we had the greatest night  one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world  and i won  and i said  oh  the great thing  i said to ivanka  i said to the first lady  i said to anybody that would listen  i said  listen  this is so great  finally  finally  we  all of us  we're going to be respected by the media  and you know what happened  they got worse  they're worse now than they ever have been  they're crooked as hell  they're worse now than they've ever been  they're crooked  the only message these radicals  and they are radical lefties  will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd  2020  save that date  with your help  we will win back the house  we 窶ｦ with your help  we will win back the house  we will keep the senate  and we will keep the white house in numbers like they haven't seen in a long  long time  joining us tonight are many terrific republican leaders  and they are terrific  and frankly  if they're not  i'm not going to introduce them  okay  but we have some great leaders  and you have great leaders in texas  great leaders  and they love texas  a friend of mine  a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure  we had this unbelievable relationship  in fact  when ted cruz held a rally in washington  he said  ""could you come to my rally "" and everybody thought  these people thought that was strange  they said to me  ""well  when is the fighting between these two "" because we really like each other  ""when's the fighting going to start "" right  ted  they said  ""when is the fighting going to start  and i said  ""don't worry  it'll start  and when it does  it's going to be vicious "" and it was vicious  and now we love each other again  he's great  ted cruz  and he had a great victory against a man that spent almost  100 million dollars  that's a lot of money  spent almost  100 million  but that was a great victory  thank you  ted  another man who's currently running against somebody  i kept thinking maybe beto will jump in because he's at zero right now  we hope he's going to jump in  remember  no religion and no guns  i think that's not good  oh  and i think he's like pretty light on oil production too  but a man and john  i have no idea who you're running against  but nobody's going to be able to beat john cornyn  he's a good man  you're good man  thank you  john  and we have a lot of congress people here  we have a woman who's fantastic  who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning  kay granger  thank you  kay  we have a man who's smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty  but he loves this state and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through  louie gohmert  louie  he's a great guy  been a great friend of mine  i'll tell you once we got him on board  he wouldn't leave us no matter what  and he had mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out  right  louie  a person who's been an incredible ally  again  loves your state  randy weber  thank you randy  great job  thank you  one of the best lawyers you'll ever find  he's slick  he's smooth  but boy he's loyal  he's talented and he's got them all buffaloed because they're not as good as him  john ratliff  thank you john  a man i saw on television last night defending me  brilliantly defending me  i actually don't like doing this usually  but i tweeted out  i said  ""thank you very much brian babin  that was a great defense  i appreciate it "" thank you brian  that was great last night  see i put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour  thanks brian  i just said thanks  and you know what  he'd rather have that too actually  right

head of michigan  michigan hadn't been won by a republican for decades and it was tough  they all said you couldn't win michigan  i said  ""why  we're getting these massive crowds  why""  and she was in charge of michigan and i said  ""i want you to do me a favor  find out who this woman is  she's driving me crazy  she calls me  just one more trip  sir  one more trip  who is she  who is she "" and it was ronna and we won the state of michigan  we won  and when it came time  when it came time to picking somebody to head the rnc  republican national committee  i said  ""what about that woman that drove me crazy from michigan "" and it was ronna and she's done a fantastic job  thank you  thank you  ronna  thank you  she's fantastic  and a great governor from your state  he's a great  great man and a friend of mine  and together with your lieutenant governor dan patrick  well you had a hurricane  two years ago now  they still keep calling me for money  ""sir  could you give us another "" when the governor called up  dan was there  ""thank you for being so generous to texas  sir  the hurricane "" it was a big one  it was a bad one  a lot of water dump  i think the biggest dump of water  remember kept going in and out  in and out  our coast guard saved 16 000 lives  but it kept going in and out  water  water  and finally i get a call  i paid billions and billions of dollars to the state  like numbers  my people are driving me crazy  i get a call from the governor and dan is there  where's dan  is he here  where's dan  dan  dan patrick  and the two of them call me  and then i had ted cruz on my back and i had john cornyn on my back and i had the congressman calling and it was brutal  it wasn't even fair  and they said  ""sir  thank you for being so generous on the hurricane "" they made a fortune  you made a fortune on the hurricane  ""thank you for being so generous  sir  sir  we want one more small request  just a small  it's not much and we appreciate your listening to us  we want to build a dam in the ocean so that if we ever have another hurricane  sir  the water won't be able to come into houston and all of the areas that have came into  sir  do you think we could do it  i said  ""how much  it's only  10 billion   10 billion "" right ted  right   10 billion they wanted  10  and you know the way they sell it and it's so good they're salesman  they're incredible salesman  they say it's only 10 billion  i'm supposed to be happy  oh  let's see  could we give texas an extra 10 billion for some  crazy thing that may work and it may not  right  no  they're great people  they love your state  rnc  co-chairman  tommy hicks  a real friend of ours  thank you  tommy  and our great campaign manager  the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen  remember they used to say with hillary  her campaign is so sophisticated  then after she lost  they said  trump's campaign was so sophisticated  and remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did  you know the old days  my father taught me  if you can spend less  that's a good thing not a bad thing  right  my father said  if you can spend less  so we spent much less then hillary  crooked hillary  crooked hillary  where are those emails  hillary  they may find those 33 000 emails  they're looking  they may find those deleted emails  they may find them  remember the emails  33 000 emails covering her gym and her daughter's wedding  33 000 that's a lot of emails for a wedding and working out  but brad parscale did a great job  thank you  brad  thank you  thank you  brad  and secretary of commerce  one of the legends of wall street  he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job  wilbur ross  thank you  wilbur  smart guy  and a friend of mine  he's another one  he was so tough  he was nasty  man  boy  he hit me during the campaign  i said  ""that guy's ruthless "" and when it was sort of over  there was nobody more gracious and i called him  i made him secretary of energy  he's done a phenomenal job  and rick perry couldn't have done a better job  truly  truly  and he's going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here  whatever he does it's going to be successful  but he spent three years with us and i want to thank you  rick  what a job you done  thank you  what a job he's done  he was also a great governor of texas that you know  in everything we do  we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country  this includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars  endless wars  they don't stop  they don't stop  they go on forever  we become policemen  we end up becoming police  were policing these countries  that's not what it's about  we've spent eight trillion dollars in the middle east  thousands of american soldiers have lost their lives  tens of thousands more have been severely wounded  and in all fairness  the other side has lost millions of people  millions  millions of people  think of it  these wars brought mass chaos  instability  destruction and death  today we choose a different path  we had tremendous success today  i don't know if you've seen it  we built in the last three years  we built the strongest military by far  and i told this story  i was embarrassed to tell it  but now i'll tell  when i first got in  a general told me we could've had a conflict with someone said  ""sir  we don't have ammunition "" and i said  ""i never want to hear a president 窶ｦ i just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as president of the united states  we don't have ammunition "" think of how bad  now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it  and as you all know  i guess you've been watching today  i sent vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo to lead an american delegation to meet with president erdogan of turkey  they got there today and it did work  without spilling a drop of american blood  not one drop of american blood  we've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of syria and it was unconventional what i did  i said  ""they're going to have to fight a little while  sometimes you have to let them fight a little while  then people find out how tough the fighting is "" these guys know right up here  these guys know  right  sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot  you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart  but it was unconventional  but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious  and the kurds  who are our friends and turkey's our friend  but they fought  it was tougher  i mean it was nasty and you couldn't make a deal for 15  think of it  for 15 years  20 years  they couldn't make a deal  the kurds didn't want to move  turkey didn't want to budge  and turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region  in all fairness to turkey  they were having a lot of bad  but they didn't 窶ｦ now all of a sudden they're fighting and it's not fun having bullets going all over the place  and we went there and we said  we want to pause  and the kurds have been terrific  they're going to move back a little bit  we're going to keep isis all nice and locked up  okay  we're going to find more of them  and turkey's all set and president erdogan one was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that i put on the country  we put the worst  i mean  i don't think they could have economically survived  but that doesn't matter  president erdogan was a gentleman  he understood it  but without a little tough love  you know what tough love is  right  without a little tough love  they would have never made this deal  president obama lost a million people in the area  a million people  a million people  so now we're doing a five day period  we're going to see if we can get it all finalized and i think it will be  i think it will be  so turkey's going to be happy  the kurds are going to be happy  isis is going to be unhappy  we'll deal with whoever we have to deal with  but we'll get it done  and it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to vice president pence and thank you to mike pompeo  good job  good job and they're traveling back to our country by night  they're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it  but it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution  we added that in  a lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible  so we have to fundamentally change our approach to homeland security as an example  in that example  nobody would've ever done that  you have to be a little bit different to do it that way  i took a lot of heat  even from some of our congressman  even from some of our senators  but now they're all happy and i'm happy with them  i'm happy with them  now  i don't know what about the democrats  the democrats will say  ""oh  what a terrible 窶ｦ"" anything we do the democrats will criticize  if i said  like on the china deal  ""we get beijing for one dollar "" they would say  ""what a terrible deal "" it just doesn't work with them  you know the wall  we spend so much time with them on the wall and i realized about two weeks ago  all i had to do is say  ""we will never build a wall "" and they would have come through and they said  ""we demand that you build it "" it would have been so much easier  right  would have been so much easier  ted  would've been so much easier  american combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world  bring our soldiers back home  bring our soldiers back home  the same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions  their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with american issued visas  oh  isn't that wonderful  and by the way  the democrats want open borders  they want everybody to flow in  they want those caravans to flow in  the caravans  and they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes  but you know what  mexico's been great  mexico today had 27 000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people  and many of them are bad people  you know when countries send them up  they're not sending their finest  okay  use your heads  they're not sending their finest  you've got to see some of the people  but now we send them back  and by the way  ice is fantastic  they've taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers  they've taken thousands of killers and brought them back  and now we've made deals with guatemala and honduras and el salvador and mexico  but we've made deals now where we can bring back  there are 45 000 people waiting in mexico  but it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back  when did you ever hear that  used to have no people waiting in mexico  they just flooded  our borders are getting strong  when the wall is complete  there'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world  my administration believes in a simple principle  the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of america is deny them  just deny them admission in the first place  it's really pretty simple  and that is why i have imposed  and we had passed and we won at the united states supreme court  a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places  but if democrats seize power  they would throw the floodgates wide open  wide open  we would have people coming into our country  look at what's going on in california and the people of california don't want it  they say  come into california  we'll give you free healthcare  free education  why wouldn't 窶ｦ i may even move to california if they keep going  no  but all it does is it brings everybody in  what's wrong with these people  we're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid  senseless  endless wars  we've invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the usa and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 f-35 fighters  stealth  stealth  and many of them are built right here  right here  you know that right  in fort worth  as we restore our security  we're also restoring our prosperity  america is winning again and america is respected again  and by the way  i have to say this  so outside they have close to 30 000 people  and i wonder if i could ask the fire marshal  fill up this little area  let them in  it would be so nice  you know they have a certain max  we broke the record tonight  good place  last month  unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years  seven million americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election  what a great 窶ｦ one point three million children have been lifted out of poverty  think of that  and african american  hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history  our great hispanic american population has reached a poverty level  which is a all time low in u s  history  and after years of stagnation  wages for hispanic americans are rising fast  up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that's absolutely impossible  medium income  think of this  median income for hispanic americans has surpassed  50 000 a year for the first time ever  with republicans in congress  we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in american history  by the way  the democrats want to raise your taxes  you know  i don't mean a little bit  i don't mean a little bit  i mean like double them up  triple them up and it's still won't pay for the nonsense they want  we eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called american energy  which is very good for texas  since my election  natural gas production in texas has increased 35% and oil production has increased by 60%  six oh  and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  world  yet every major democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas  i think they want to go to windmills  windmills  you know  ""darling  i want to watch trump speak tonight  we can't darling  the wind isn't blowing "" they want windmills  in other words  they want to annihilate your texas economy  can you imagine  no more oil  no more natural  so here we have a few people  right  no guns  no religion  no oil  no natural gas  abraham lincoln could not win texas under those circumstances  couldn't do it  couldn't do it  ted  couldn't do it  louis  abraham lincoln  honest abe  couldn't do it  louie  right  remember i used to say i can be more presidential  look  i've always said i can be more presidential than any president in history except for honest abe lincoln when he's wearing the hat  that's tough  that's tough  that's a tough one to beat  no  it's much easier  being presidential is easy  all you have to do is act like a stiff  look  remember the last election  they said these phonies in the back  they said  texas is in play  they said you'd toss in play too  and i came here  we had rallies like this  thousands of people outside that couldn't get in  and i said  ""why is texas in play "" they say because it's voting  it's suppression  they try and get your hopes down  they're suppressed  this is just like fake news  but they said texas  they said texas is in play  ""ladies and gentlemen  texas is play  this is cnn  texas is in play  president trump 窶ｦ"" and i had guys on from texas and they're wearing cowboy hats  sid and a lot of guys  they go  ""i don't know about you  but i know something about texas and donald trump is not going to lose texas  i can tell you that and texas is not in play "" 00 o'clock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if it's big  they take a half an hour  the texas polls have closed and usually if it's close  it takes hours  and if it's not even just like so close  it takes a long time  so they go  ""ladies and gentlemen  the polls have closed in the state of texas  donald trump has won the state of texas  right  donald trump "" and we won by a lot  we won by a lot  and we won florida and we won south carolina and we won georgia and we won north carolina and we won pennsylvania  we won a lot  remember these phony people  there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to 窶ｦ so i kept going to maine  i love maine  but maine too  you get one  it's cut in half  maine too you get one  i went there four or five times because 窶ｦ they got me up  the phonies  they got me up to 269  couldn't get to 270 so i went 窶ｦ i won  by the way  i won maine too  i got one  but i went there and i went there a lot  that's the beautiful thing about the electoral college  you go everywhere  you don't just spend the three 窶ｦ winning the popular vote would be much easier  i'd rather have that  i'd go to four states and relax  i went to 21 states  i used to be a believer in the other  but i think winning 窶ｦ it's like you're a track star  you're working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile  it's a different form of training  it's a different form  but we did great  they said he cannot get to 270 and they were right  we got to 306  after decades of economic surrender  i have taken historic action to confront china's- 窶ｦ have taken historic action to confront china's rampant trading abuses  and we've made great progress  and our relationship with china is fantastic  and great things are happening  you watch  they get it now  they get it  and a lot of good things are happening  we're replacing nafta with disastrous  i mean  it's been  to me  probably 窶ｦ i used to call it the worst trade deal in history  i think the world trade has been 窶ｦ wto  what a real beauty  the world trade organization  that's a real beauty  they consider china a developing nation  and because you're a developing nation  ted  right  they consider china to be a developing nation  and because they're developing  they get tremendous 窶ｦ and we wrote them letters  we don't consider them to be a developing nation  we don't consider india to be a develop窶ｦ because they're ripping us off  and we didn't win any cases at the wto  and now we just won  7 5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us  and we've won a lot of cases lately  we didn't win anything for years practically  now we've won a lot of cases  you know why  because they know i'll leave if they don't treat us fairly  they know it  and then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from  we're replacing the nafta disaster  and we have to get this crazy nancy pelosi to put this thing up for a vote  we have to get her  and the usmca is a giant victory for texas farmers  ranchers  manufacturers  workers  and oil  the democrats should pass it  overwhelmingly  they will  but nancy has to put it up for a vote  do-nothing democrats  they're do-nothing  nowhere is the democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration  in recent debates  did you see these debates  do you believe what i'm competing with  i don't know  when i had to compete with ted cruz  that was brutal  he was the national debate chamption  a story i've never told  i never did that before  right  i ran for office  all of a sudden  i'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night   ""who are these people "" the hell  i don't know all of them  i know a lot of them  i contributed to a lot of them  they used to treat me very nice when i contributed to them  not so nice when i was their opponent  that changed a lot   ""let me see  i want to see  who are these people "" i'm going to a debate  i never debated  my whole life has been a debate  but i never debated with a podium  and this  and that   ""who are they "" and we had 17 people  plus me  we had 18  it was actually not 17  it was 18  remember gilmore  nobody remembers him  but we had 18 people  i said  ""who are these people  are they any good at debating "" and i hired a debate coach  and he lasted for about 10 minutes   ""this guy knows less than i do "" he didn't know anything  he didn't know anything  it's true  he said  ""never ever interrupt while they're speaking ""  ""okay  coach  put me in  coach "" and after a couple of those statements  i mean 窶ｦ i mean  you can't beat ted cruz if you don't interrupt him  it's impossible  but my first 窶ｦ it's true  so i see  ""let me see the cards  let me see the whole thing  i want to see it  i need help  i'm going to be debating in front of millions of people "" and everyone's saying  ""do you think trump's going to be able to debate professionally ""  ""let me see these cards ""  ""you know  he was president of his class  one guy was a good debater in college  he was this  he was okay "" but they give me the first card  ted cruz  and it says  ""national debate champion from princeton "" is that right  and then  ""national debate champion from harvard ""  ""my potential first lady  i got a problem ""  ""some of these guys are okay  they were only president of the class "" almost all of them ran for president of the class  i never did  i liked playing baseball better  but i said  ""melania "" and i called ivanka  i called my kids  i said  ""i got a problem  ted cruz was the national debate  he was the number one guy in college  he was the number one guy in law school  how the hell do i beat a guy that's that good at debating "" but we came out okay  ted  and ted  ted was tough  smart as hell and tough  tough  good man  but it is true  the first card i looked at  seriously  it was ted cruz  and he was literally  i mean  national debate  he was the best in all of college and in law school  and he's a talented guy  no  he says  i don't think so  every single democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens  they want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to american citizens  you see that  as president  i will never allow the democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally  can't do it  in fact  i just signed an executive action to protect american healthcare benefits for all american citizens  among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in texas  including millions of patriotic  hardworking mexican-americans who play by the rules  pay their taxes  follow our laws  and strengthen our communities  whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation  and every american citizen  and you do  you've been treated so badly  but you're not being treated badly anymore  you know  we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy obamacare  every american citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs  your safety  your family  your borders  and is always loyal to you for a change  we're loyal to you  my administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since may  and that's with no help from the democrats  they won't close up the loopholes  they won't close the loopholes  and we could do it in 15 minutes  and we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things  but the democrats won't close up the loopholes  you know what the loopholes are  right  how about catch and release  you catch them  you say  ""hello  darling  how are you  could you please give us your name and phone number "" they don't have a phone  ""could you give us your address "" they don't want to have that have a phone  could you give us your address  they don't want to have an address that's in honduras  ""could you please give us your address and your name "" they can't  they say  ""that's okay  we catch and we release "" and they go into our country  and then we are getting them out of the country  and you know what  some are very good people  some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people  and we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country  okay  while we're fighting for shared priorities  the american people  the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream  they've gone nuts  every democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate medicare  my administration will always protect medicare for our beloved seniors  and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions  our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years  people don't talk about it  the press will not talk about it  we have news conferences  we tell them this  they will not put it in the press  you have no idea how dishonest the media is  you have no idea  virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth  and that crackpot governor from virginia executes the baby after birth  you saw that  right  after birth  you remember that one from last year  that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of crazy politicians  high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  they're corrupt  like schiff is corrupt  he's corrupt  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and it's the party of the american dream  it's also the party of honest abe lincoln  we forget that  we got to use that more often  don't you think  honest abe  i liked honest abe  we've confirmed 窶ｦ he says ""honest donald "" thank you  explain that to them  you're right  we've confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written  including two supreme court justices  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  when i got into office  they say the most important thing a president can do  i actually think it's defense  but they say is the appointment of federal judges  so when i got in  always  when you get in  there are none  "" how many do you have "" ""i have none  none "" so i got to  i say  ""how many federal judges do i have "" ""sir  you have 142 federal judges "" ""no  you don't understand the question "" that's impossible  that would mean that president obama didn't appoint 142 judges  you get none  or you're doing a bad job as president because you're representing a different philosophy  very different   ""actually  sir  the number is 142  we were right the first time ""  ""obama was 窶ｦ he's such a wonderful president "" how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do  you handed over to the republicans  142  how is that good  i mean  how is that good  if i were a democrat  i wouldn't be too happy about that number  and we'll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years  maybe 20  i'm only kidding  i'm only kidding because every time i do that  they say  ""see  he's assuming control "" we have this crazy guy on television  and he goes  ""you know 窶ｦ"" he's talking to a guest  he goes  ""you know he's going to win  don't you  you know he's going to win "" i mean  we've done a good job  he should be happy  but he said  "" our military  our schools  our this  everything "" he says  ""you know he's going to win "" and the guest goes  ""well  no  we're going to fight  we're going to fight "" ""no  no  he's going to win  and you know he's never leaving  you know that  don't you  he's never leaving  he's never going to leave "" and i thought this wacko was kidding  he's a comedian  i thought he was kidding  he's serious  he really believes that  we passed  for the veterans  va choice and va accountability on behalf of those great people  they've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years  they couldn't get it done  but those guys right there  and me  we got it done  and to protect american security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  for years  you watched as your politicians apologized for america  you've seen it many times  ""oh  i'm so sorry "" now you have a president who's standing up for america and standing up for your great state of texas   about you  i'm doing this for you  you know  we had  in 2016  i really believe it was maybe the greatest election  i guess george washington was good  right  but that was easy  and by the way  he did even better percentage-wise in judges than i did  he had 100%  but we could have 50%  that's not bad  and i had many more than he had  so i guess you got to give george washington  what do you think  ted  you got to give him something  i'd say honest abe  that was a pretty good election  right  andrew jackson  they say ours topped andrew jackson  but andrew jackson was a good election  but we had among the greatest elections of all time  but we have to now cement that election  we got to cement it  and once we do  it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart  that'll be very hard  because it's all about your family  it's all about your future  and it's all about the future fate of our great country  so important  with your help  we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a safe  modern  fair  and lawful system of immigration  and by the way  thank you  robert jeffress  for being here  wherever you may be in this massive 窶ｦ wherever you are  robert  where is he  he got up  he started saying  ""he may not be the greatest person "" i said 窶ｦ this is like four years ago  i see this guy  what a mouthpiece  this guy  and he's a man of god   ""he may not be the greatest  he may not be the most perfect christian  he may not know the bible as well as some of us  but he's a leader  and i love donald trump ""  ""who is that guy  i love that guy "" robert jeffress  wherever  he's a great guy  got a big  big group of people on sunday mornings too  i can tell you  we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words  that beautiful phrase  i love it  ""made in the usa "" we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years  we're doing that  who would have believed we could do that  we're doing that  and the previous administration spent no money on that  and we're spending a lot  but think of that  who would have thought that we're going to end  within 10 years  the aids epidemic in our country  who would have thought we've advanced that far  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of texas  this is a great state  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united

7,30,Jan,2020,datasets/DesMoines,"i worked so hard for this state  i worked so hard  you just got two of the greatest trade deals  and add japan to it  by the way  let's make it three  40 billion from japan  usmca  all done  china  all done for the farmers  it's done  that i can tell you  you're going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land  you've got to produce a lot of product  i don't know if you can  but  hello des moines  it's great to be with you  i'm thrilled to be back in american heartland with thousands of loyal  hardworking american patriots  great people  this november we're going to defeat the radical socialist democrats that are right down the street  i mean  i don't even know  i just saw  new york times  can you believe  failing new york times窶ｦ when we leave in 10  14  18  22 years from now  the new york times will be out of business and so will a lot of others  but  did you see they did a new york times poll  i think  and sienna  sienna  new york times of iowa  and they have me pitted against every one of the socialists  and we're winning by a lot  everyone  we're beating them all  we're beating them all  we're beating them all  we're beating them like they haven't been beaten before  you know all the noises about their crazy debates  nobody's watching their debates  but it's all about their debates  they don't care about the farmer  everything out here  they love trump  and you should love trump with what i've done  so  we're going to win the great state of iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide  if we don't win  your farms are going to hell  i can tell you right now  sell  sell  they'll be saying ""sell "" no  we love the farmers  and we love the ranchers  and we love the manufacturers  frankly  you got plenty of that too in this state  the great state  and you have a great governor  by the way  you have a great governor  but every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the hawkeye state  the iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history  that's not bad  that's not bad  oh  let's vote for pocahontas  let's vote for bernie  let's vote for sleepy joe  he's falling asleep  joe  joe  joe  he always gets the name wrong  how many times has he missed it  he's in iowa  he says  ""great to be in the great state of ohio "" they say  ""joe  you're in iowa "" you can't do that  no matter how great you speak  if you're winston churchill  if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech  it's over  you might as well just wrap it up  there's the fake news  they would just absolutely destroy you  they would absolutely destroy you  you can't do that  you can't do that  joe  sleepy joe  but you have these guys  you have these people  how about buttigieg  buttigieg  they call him mayor pete  you know why  because nobody can pronounce his name  nobody has any idea  buttigieg  they say  ""say edge edge "" he presides over a city that's failed  it's doing so badly  in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had  and they have a great governor also  and they had a great governor  you just heard from him  right  the great state of indiana  so i don't see that one  go down the line  we have some people  let's not talk about them  what happened to mini mike  where is he  he's not running  he's skipping four or five states  mini mike  i've had him up to here  more people are working right now in iowa than ever before  now think of it  think of it  yesterday we replaced a nafta disaster with the incredible brand new u s  mexico canada agreement  the usmca  you know when you have a hard time with that one  memory is a great thing  i've always had a great memory for whatever reason  but memory is a great thing  having a great memory  but sometimes you take little clues  usmca  thank you  darling  i love you  too  where is that person up  look at that  wow  what a good  strong voice  but you know how you remember it  the song i just walked in on  they're playing the song ymca  so  when you're having a hard time  gee  what's u-s  just think of the song ymca  and you'll remember it  usmca  it's a massive win for iowa farmers and workers of all kinds  it's a massive win and it creates some fairness with canada  it creates fairness with mexico  probably the biggest reason that i ran was the unfair trade that i've seen  and one after one  china  mexico  canada  japan  south korea  we've made all these deals  and we have plenty left over  plenty left over  europe  europe  europe is next  i wanted to finish china before we started on europe  i like to do them one at a time  one at a time  i'm a very organized person  but weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with china that will boost american agriculture by  50 billion every year  and many other businesses like manufacturing  banking  finance  overall  250 billion  and you know with the farmers  because i have a place in my heart for the farmers big  i went and i saw ambassador lighthizer's in charge  he's fantastic  i said  ""what are you doing  we're getting ready for the final deal  what are you doing "" he said  ""i'm putting in  20 billion "" because i asked sonny perdue  he's great  you know who he is  right  secretary of agriculture  i said  ""sonny  what's the biggest number that china's ever done with the farmers "" he said  ""sir   16 billion last year   16 billion "" this was two years ago  i said  ""so   16 billion is the biggest "" because you know  they targeted you  and now we're friends with china  in fact  maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the coronavirus  we're working with them very  very closely  we only have five people  hopefully everything's going to be great  they have somewhat of a problem  but hopefully it's all going to be great  but  we're working with china just so you know  and other countries very  very closely  so it doesn't get out of hand  but it's something that we have to be very  very careful with  right  we have to be very careful  but i said to sonny perdue  secretary of agriculture  i said  ""sonny  what's the number "" 16 and 12 the year before  and you were targeted  i don't blame china  look  they're smart  they're negotiators  they targeted trump states  where do they love trump  they love him in iowa  they love him in nebraska  they love him in all these states  they love him in wisconsin  they love him  we won wisconsin  they like him and wisconsin  and a lot of the farm states  and they targeted  the farmers came to see me and they said  ""sir  you have to do what's right "" when the fake news would interview farmers  the farmers would say  ""no  no  president trump is doing the right thing  it should have been done years ago  should've been done years and years ago "" but you couldn't have made it because there was too much money   16 billion  so  what i did is i put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from china   250 billion  and then more tariffs on things beyond the  250 billion market  we took in billions  and billions  and billions of dollars  we still are  and then what happened  when i heard about the farmers and i saw the farmers  they were in the white house  they came to see me  i had 36 farmers and i said  ""i'm going to give you "" they said  ""sir  we don't want anything "" i said  ""what do you mean you don't want anything  i've never heard that before "" everybody wants money  they want every  they said  ""we just want a level playing field "" i never forgot it  they said  ""we don't want anything  we just want a level playing field  and we've been treated badly for years  for years "" i said  ""well  you haven't been given a level playing field for many  many years  for decades  you haven't been given a level playing field  we're going to give you the levelest field that you ever had  but  but in the meantime  i'm going to give you  12 billion  out of these tens of billions that we're collecting "" don't worry  we had plenty of left over  because we never got 25 cents from china  china took from us  we didn't take from china  right  i said  ""i'm going to give you  12 billion for the year before  and i'm going to give you  16 billion for this year "" that was last year for this year  so  they got  meaning you  a lot of you in this audience  got  12 billion  and you got 16  so you got  28 billion over that short period of time  and you were able to actually  in some cases  i guess thrive  i told sonny  ""i want to take care of the small farmer too  not just the big monsters  i want to take care of everyone  everyone "" but  i never forgot when cnn fake news and all these people  they go around interviewing the farmers  they could never find anyone saying bad about trump  they'd go into diners  ""what do you think about trump  isn't it a terrible what he's doing with the trade "" the farmer would say  ""no  he's doing what should have been done 20 years ago "" now  you people are going to make so much money  you're not going to do just  you know what  just relax  take it easy  put it away  enjoy your life  but you're going to make a lot of money  you're going to make a lot of money  again  we have never had  because they respect us now  they didn't respect us  we have never had a better relationship with china than we do right now  it's a beautiful story  they respect us  the whole world respects us now  we're respected again  america is respected again  okay  we're fighting for products made in america and grown right here in this great  great state of iowa  to keep america safe  we have fully rebuilt the united states military  it's now stronger  more powerful  more lethal than ever before  we have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the usa  thanks to the courage of american heroes  the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader  the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead  crazy nancy pelosi said  ""don't call him an animal  he's a human being "" no  he's an animal  he's an animal  two weeks ago  at my direction  the united states military delivered another historic win for american justice  our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist  qasem soleimani  qasem soleimani  he was the mastermind of the road side bomb  he loved roadside bombs  when you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries  frankly  walking around  they don't have legs  they don't have arms in some cases  some cases they don't have both  you see them walking around  or riding around  or the most brave people  these people have the greatest attitude  i go to walter reed and i see him and the young man his legs were blown off  ""how you doing "" ""sir  i want to get back  i want to get back  sir "" i'll tell you  the spirit of these people  it may even top the farmers  it may even top the farmers  which is pretty good  but he was responsible  more than anybody else  90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us  he was responsible and he took a hard hit  he took a very hard hit  he was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of americans  and hundreds of thousands of other people  not acceptable  soleimani was actively planning new attacks  but we ended his bloody rampage forever  yet  washington democrats  true  like crazy bernie and nancy pelosi  opposed our decision to eliminate soleimani  and to save american lives  that had a tremendous impact  while we're proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists  congressional democrats are consumed with partisan rage  and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax  you know  we're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country  and i just got impeached  can you believe these people  i got impeached  they impeached trump  the best trade deals  the strongest military  i took care of the vets  we got choice  we got accountability for the vets  accountability  we got all these things and they impeach your president  no  that's not going to work  watch  just watch  they want to nullify your ballots  poison our democracy  and overthrow the entire system of government  that's not happening  i can tell you that  washington democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election  why am i not worried  i should worried  remember nixon  it was like a dark period  right  it's a very dark period  it was like oh  you think about it  right  with clinton it was not good  they say that with johnson  it was a long time ago  none of us remember  but they say it was a very dark period  this is a happy period for us  it's a happy period  it's a happy period because we call this impeachment light  this is light  crazy schiff  shifty schiff  he's a sick puppy  he's a sick puppy  but  you know what  today you saw it  i hit my highest poll numbers since i got elected because the american people  and frankly  people all over the world  know it's a hoax  they understand it  they know it's a hoax  and we have a great party  the republican party  they know what's going on  they know what's going on and they're going to treat us very fairly  but  the democrats are trying to overturn the last election  we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020  november 3  november 3  mark it off  november 3  mark it off  was that a great day  2016 november  remember  he's not going to do well with this group  i did well  he's not going to do well with that group  i won that group  he's not going to do well here or there  even the exit polls  they took it right up  you know what they didn't know about the exit polls  when people are leaving  they're always very accurate  people leave  ""who you voted for "" ""i voted for trump "" ""who you voted for "" ""i voted for crooked hillary  i don't care that she's a stone cold crook  i'm voting for her "" who are you voting for  i'm voting for trump  or clinton  or trump  they're always very accurate  but this time something happened  many people  many窶ｦ i like that idea  i like it  i like it  wouldn't we like to run against her  who's tougher  her  crazy bernie  biden  buttigieg  who would be the closest  buttigieg  i don't know  maybe we take another crack at crazy hillary  would that be okay  she was so easy  remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables  remember  remember deplorables  but you know the only thing i didn't understand  i said  ""that's terrible "" but she said another word that was worse  irredeemables  i said  ""boy "" shows you how good i am at politics  i said  ""she's in trouble  she said our people are irredeemable "" to me that was worse  well  it wasn't that word that caught on  it was deplorable  the next day i'm speaking  and women are walking around  i'm deplorable  everyone's got deplorable  i say  ""i think she made a bad speech last night "" but irredeemable  remember  she called them deplorable and irredeemable  and me being so brilliant  i said  ""i think that irredeemables going to get her "" no  deplorable got her  a lot her like lack of ability  together we are going to win back the house  we are going to hold the senate  and we are going to keep that beautiful  gorgeous  incredible white house  people don't realize this is a lot of work  i just left michigan  and michigan is booming now because of me  meaning  my people  i say to prime minister abe  he's a friend of mine  ""shinzo "" japan  ""you got to do something  you got these massive deficits for our country  you got to open up plants in michigan fast  shinzo  fast  you've got to do it "" ""yes  i will do it "" he'll do it  and he's doing it  countries are coming in from all over the world  they're going to michigan  they're coming to iowa  they're buying your stuff again  like crazy  like crazy  they're going to ohio  they're going to pennsylvania  they're going to south carolina  they're going to north carolina  they're going to florida  they're coming in like never before  they're all coming back  i ran on the issue trade  i ran on a lot of different issues  but trade was one of them  that was so big  to me  it was so big  i used to say  how do we allow these companies to close  fire everybody  go to another country  mexico  wherever it may be  make product  sell the product into our country  pay no tax  who the hell would allow this to happen  who would allow to happen  it's like in south korea  i went to him  i said  ""listen  your deal is no good  we have to make a new deal "" south korea  we're protecting them all  all these different things  i said  ""number one  you've got to pay us more "" they agreed to  they gave us  500 million a year more  they said  ""but nobody has ever asked "" they gave us 500  that's nothing compared to what they have to do  that's okay  that's okay  they'll pay more  but you know  they made a trade deal with the united states  hillary clinton was in charge of the deal  right  she said it's going to produce 250 000 jobs  and she was right  250 000  you know who it was for  for south korea  not for us  it was for south korea  so  we renegotiated the deal  if i have your permission  we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with south korea  okay  this deal is going to produce  remember窶ｦ this deal is going to produce 250 000 jobs for south korea  she didn't lie  can't say she lied  she lies about a lot of other things  but she didn't lie  how is she taking her defeat  okay  i think so  remember the debate  do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and i sort of  i didn't exactly say yes  i didn't say yes  in all fairness  but i got sort of like six the 68% there  but she said  ""see he won't "" she's the one that doesn't do it  no  no  i feel badly because it's too late for her to get in  i kept hoping  but i think  honestly i think that sleepy joe  crazy bernie  i don't even want to put buttigieg in  but i think they'd actually be tougher than her  during this campaign season  the good people of iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left  this is a radical left people that we're dealing with  today's democrat party  i don't say democratic party  it sounds so much better in a speech  right  democratic party  the democrat  but that's not their name  it's called the democrat party  you know some people aren't allowed to say the democrat party because it doesn't sound good  i don't even like it  i don't like the way it sounds in this speech  but i'm going to say it because i'm not looking to have them look good  today's democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes  increase regulations  cancel your health plans  raid medicare  shut down american energy  destroy your social security  they will destroy your social security  eliminate religious liberty  punish free speech  confiscate your guns  abolish your borders  and indoctrinate america's children with hateful  left-wing ideology  other than that  they're okay  other than that  they're fine people  in short  this election is a choice between american freedom and democratic socialism  and in some cases  in my opinion  it's worse than socialism  socialism's a kind word by comparison  the democrats will lose because america will never be a socialist country  we can't  they're all watching tonight  they're sitting in their hotel room  little hotels right down the street  and they're looking at this crowd  the press never talks about my crowds  did you see in new jersey a couple of nights ago  we had signups for 175 000 people  we had an arena that held about 9 000 people  we could have sold it out 15 times  okay  they don't talk about that  you know what they talk about  they said donald trump who spoke before a nice crowd  if bernie or sleepy joe has  i mean joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table  no  it's true  no  they were in a gymnasium  there were in a gymnasium  and they set up a round table  and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked  ""what do you think of socialism "" they just said  ""i just want to be here to watch his speech "" they set up a round- they just said  ""i just want to be here to watch a speech "" they set up a round table because the crowd was so small  and then they'll say  ""it was a brilliant round table  it was wonderful "" they never mention crowds  they never mention crowds  they never mention anything  i'll tell you  u s m c a  the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world  okay  it is  wait  it barely got any mention  we signed it  it barely got any mention  they talk about the impeachment hoax  they talk about all the other stuff  but the trade deal  that is going to change our country  it's going to bring growth  wait until you see  toward the end of next year  the growth will be astronomical because of the china trade deal  the u s m c a  japan  south korea  europe  when that happens  it will happen because they have no choice  they have no choice  but in the papers  and on the fake news cable shows  and the regular  look  nbc is horrible  the nbc nightly news  it's terrible  the good news is people don't watch it like they used to  because they don't believe in it  they don't believe in it  and as sean hannity would say  msdnc  you know what msdnc is  right  so bad  cnn  total fake stuff  oops  their camera just went off  look  the camera just went off  cnn  their camera just went off  that always happens whenever i say cnn  their camera goes off  but americans  across the political spectrum  were disgusted by the washington democrats  the partisan hoaxes  the witch hunts  the con jobs  it's all a con job  and so  they don't love our country  i swear they don't  you look at nancy pelosi's district in san francisco  it was so beautiful  and now it's a disgrace  being watched all over the world  needles all over the place  everything else all over the place  i'm not going to get into it  washing down into the ocean  washing down onto their beaches  people living in tents if they're lucky  i mean you never saw anything  living on their most important entryways into what was a great city  san francisco  what's happened  and all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff  really  these people are very  very bad for our country  we have to take back the house of representatives  we have to  registered democrats and independents are leaving the democrat party in droves  and we are welcoming these people  and these great voters  to the republican party with wide  open arms  and we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders  a lot of your really wonderful people  i'm not going to mention all the names  because all those cameras that are rolling  they don't like it when i do it  but one they don't mind is governor kim reynolds  come up  kim  come up here  also first gentleman  kevin reynolds  kevin  kim  come on  come on  you want to say something  great  great job  thank you  oh  she was driving me a little bit batty  she would call me up  kim  you would call  ""what about ethanol "" i said kim  ""i mean  i'm doing a lot for that place "" ""no  no  we want ethanol "" then  ""we want biofuel "" then she is asking for things i never even heard of  but we got them all  whatever that hell she wanted  we got  right  and by the way  joni ernst and the great chuck grassley are right now in washington fighting for fairness  fighting the hoax  fighting for all of us  they called  they said  ""do you mind if we don't go tonight  we have to stay "" i said  ""i don't want you to be there  i want you to be where you are"" because they are fighting for us  they are great people  they are great people  and  they would call too  chuck grassley  joni ernst  they would call  ""we got to help our farmers  sir "" ""yes  okay  we are going to help the farmer "" they were great  lieutenant governor adam gregg  thank you  adam  thank you  adam  great job  adam  speaker of the iowa house of representatives  a man with really fantastic genes  got to have like the best genes in the world  although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes  too  we have his son in the audience  too  but this is representatives pat grassley  those genes  those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics  thank you  fellas  thanks  i sent one of them  the father to china  and he's now ambassador to china  do you think he is happy  is he happy  i think so  i think he is happy  great governor  longest serving governor in history  actually  24 years  we have the chairman of the republican party of iowa  jeff kaufmann  great job  and just quickly  we have the world's tallest campaign manager  brad parscale  and republican national committee co-chair  who has done an incredible job  tommy hicks  and we have the great negotiator  the great man  bob lighthizer with us here  someplace  where's bob  what a job he did negotiating for you  and we have somebody that you never heard of  somebody that's a fantastic person  but you never heard of  somebody named sarah sanders  have you ever heard of her  come here  sarah  come on  that's pretty good  and we have a great football player  from iowa  matt whitaker is here  matt  say something  thank you  sarah  very popular  she is a terrific person  great person  thanks to republican leadership  american now has the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth  not even close  every prime minister  president  king  queen  dictator  whatever you want to call them  they all say  ""how did you do it "" and  the truth is we have certain advantages  but we also have a people advantage  we have the greatest people in the world  i really mean that  since the election  we have created seven million new jobs  the average unemployment rate  under my administration  listen to this  is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country  can you believe that  the lowest unemployment rate  african american  hispanic american  and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded  think of that  more than two million millennials  you know what millennials are  young  great people with a lot of future  they have gotten jobs  and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually  that's a record  another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34  people are now working  and that's a record  the number of people  25 to 34  and under the so-called trump economy  the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group  and that's a great thing  this is a blue collar boom  and that's a good thing too  that's a good thing  earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever  for the first time ever  and median household income is at an all time high  just for one second  president bush  eight years   450  president barack hussein obama  eight years  eight years   975  president donald john trump  two and a half years  not three  because the numbers were taken at two and a half  now it's actually higher  two and a half years  including the tax cuts which are massive  and including all of the regulatory cuts  and the other things you have gotten   10 000  think of it  you have eight years  450  eight years  975  two and a half years  think of it   10 000  it's one of the reasons the economy is doing so well  and let the people down the road tell you about that  okay  let them tell you about that  and those tractors that i told you to buy  your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it  they will be 60 years old  they will be old  tired  exhausted  your land will be exhausted  you will be exhausted  we've ended the war on american energy  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth  by far  we are also proudly promoting american ethanol  and i recently approved e15 to be used all year round  biofuel also  but the socialist democrats want to shut down american energy  they support representative ocasio-cortez  it's a real beauty  that's a real beauty  that's a beauty  i can't even believe it  but i don't want to knock it  because the green new deal  which would crush our farms  destroy our wonderful cows  i love cows  they want to kill our cows  you know why  right  you know why  don't say it  they want to kill our cows  that means you are next  and they want to wipe out  totally  iowa ethanol  they want to wipe it out  but we will never let that side get in  and by the way  that's the least of it  but i don't want to attack the green new deal  because they might change it  i said to her the other day  they said  ""what do you think of the green new deal "" i said  ""well  it should be studied carefully  we should look at it  look at it closely  i don't want to talk about until about two months before the election  and then i will tell you how totally insane it is "" how about this crazy senator  how about this crazy  crazy senator from hawaii  they said  ""i'm totally in favor "" not the smartest  she said  ""i'm totally in favor of the green new deal "" well  that would mean there's no more airplanes  ""oh "" they started screaming at her in hawaii  they said  ""how the hell are we going to get to hawaii "" they said  ""we're going to build a railroad "" she said that would be ""the world's longest track "" it's the world's longest  she doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore  and yet they fly around in brand new gulfstreams  in brand new planes all over the place  they're flying from place to place  they're talking about the carbon footprint  ""we're going to destroy the carbon footprint  what time is my plane taking off  please "" to lift up forgotten communities  the republican tax cut launched opportunity zones  jobs  and investment  and now rushing into over 60 newly窶ｦ and this is incredible  brand  newly designated opportunity zones right here in iowa alone  rich people are investing vast amounts of money  tim scott  senator tim scott  south carolina  came into my office  he said  ""i have an idea that i have wanted to do for years  but we have never had a president that could pull it off "" i said  ""what is it  tim "" and he talked about opportunity zones  first time i heard it  and we did it  and there is nothing  nobody has ever seen anything like it  money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there  what's happening is incredible  opportunity zones  remember it  for decades  politicians ran for office  promising to protect american farmers and workers  you've heard it all your lives  right  but then  they went to washington  they looked at those beautiful marble columns  and that gorgeous ceiling painted  and all that gold  the way they used to build the buildings  they don't build them that way anymore  we could  but they just don't know how  by the way  we're building the wall  you know the wall is over a hundred miles long  it's over a hundred miles long already and moving fast  they went to washington and they sold you out  that's what happened  they sold your jobs out  they sold everything out  globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories  ravage our farms  rob our workers  and ransack our communities  but the era of economic surrender is over  because now we are finally putting america first  america first  before i took office  washington looked the other way  while china stole our secrets from american agriculture  your business  what they do scientifically  nobody understands what they have done to a seed  it doesn't sound complicated  it is genius  what they have been able to do  what you have been able to do  but those secrets were being stolen  stolen  and installed massive barriers to your exports  you couldn't do anything with exports  so people  not only china  many  many other places were stealing your secrets  our new agreement with china will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for american beef  pork  poultry  seafood  soybeans  rice  dairy  and much  much more  but you know it is true  china is so big  1 5 billion people  we have 350  1 5 billion people  think of that  and we are just touching it  this deal will be so big  if it all works out  and you have the best product  the best product in the world  if it all works out  it will just keep expanding  250 billion will end up being much  much more than that  and  i've told this story before  when we were signing  we were almost finished and i said  ""how much are the farmers getting "" meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers  and ambassador lighthizer said  ""we put 20 billion  sir  the highest ever was 16  so we made it 20 "" i said ""make it 50 "" they said  ""what "" and then people  even farm people  said  ""sir  we can't produce that much "" i said  ""that's a good problem  not a bad problem "" i said  ""make it 50 "" so we now have  in the contract  from 40 to  50 billion worth of purchase "" make it 50  make it 50  right  jared  i said  ""jared  you better make it 50 "" i want those farmers to come back  say  ""sir  sir  we can't do it  we can't produce that much  sir  what are you doing to us "" i don't think that would ever happen  do you think that would ever  i said they will figure a way  he's going ""absolutely not "" nah  i said  ""don't make it 20  make it 50 "" the u s m c a  is another colossal victory for american agriculture like you have never had before  it's time  we suffered for a year and a half  almost two years  think of it  but not really because i was able to give you those  i won't call them subsidies  i made that mistake once with the farmers  i said to this group of farmers that came in  ""subsidy "" i used the word subsidy  that was the worst word  ""sir  we don't watch subsidy  please don't ever use that word "" i said  ""i won't  i promise "" just in that small  little grouping where you were doing nothing  it's called promises made  promises kept  promises met  the last time i came  i never did this before  i never ran  so they all said  ""you never ran before  you can't do this if you never ran "" so whatever happened  it happened  one by one  they started dropping out  right  and then i was left with one  hillary clinton  and that worked out very nicely  ""he cannot get to 270 "" remember  270  electoral college  ""he cannot get to 270 "" i went to maine  it's true  maine  too  it's got one point  right  one  i went there a lot  many times  everyone said  well  they kept getting me  maybe if i have a great night  269  but 269 loses  right  but we got 306 to 223  306  223  so they were right  ""you cannot get to 270  you can get to 306 "" but not that there is窶ｦ in the eight years before my election  net farm income plummeted by 20%  you know that  if you look at a chart  for 15 years actually  not eight  for 15 years  it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer  soybeans  take a look at it all  it was just a one way street  everybody was ripping off the american farmer  now you're going to see numbers that are going to be great  look at even what's happened recently  it's incredible what's going on and i love it  because you deserve it  you suffered a lot  with people that were stupid  they were stupid  under three years of my administration  net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster  what are you going to do  you are going to vote for bernie  you are going to vote for bernie  here i am on the debate stage  ""well  net income has gone up for the farmers 50% "" tell me  how the hell do i lose this debate  how do i lose  and based on the polls  i guess i'm not going to lose in this state  i don't think i will lose in any other state either  because this is really true all over the country  this is happening all over the country  not just iowa  on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on immigration  illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars  drains public services  overcrowds our schools and hospitals  and threatens innocent american lives at a number that you wouldn't even believe  but we have got it closed up  but we're getting your people in  you have people that have worked for you for a long time  don't you  i know who the people that you have  and they are hard workers  we have a lot of great people  you have a lot of great people out there  right here in des moines  a twice deported  illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman  her 11-year-old daughter  and her five-year-old son  in this region of the county alone  last year  ice officers arrested nearly 4 000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes  including robbery  rape  and murder  yet today's democrat party glorifies illegal immigration  we have no idea  now we do now  but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands  we have no idea who they are  many are fine people and all of that  but some are stone cold rapists  and murderers  and people that their countries don't want  guatemala  honduras  el salvador  and even mexico  right now we have a love affair with mexico because the democrats  the democrats wouldn't give us what we needed and i got mexico  they're great  they put up 27 000 soldiers on our southern border and the numbers are plummeting  87% down  the president of mexico is doing a great job  and we ended catch and release  you think that was easy  catch and release  you know what catch and release is  you catch a criminal  you take the number  and you release him into the  they would never come back  we say  come back please in three years  this is a democrat deal  come back if you don't mind  in three years  we release them into our country  we totally ended it through a very  very slick group of rules  catch and release  may we please have your address and your phone number  ""here it is "" ""what have you done "" ""i got out of jail "" ""oh  well  welcome to the united states  please  we have a little information  okay  and now we're going to release you  and in three and a half years  we schedule a court appearance for you "" do you believe  this is the only country in the world  they catch somebody on the border  you're supposed to be perry mason  you take them to court  other countries catch somebody at the border  they say  "" sorry  you got to get out "" we say  ""oh  may we have your information  we're taking you to court "" man  today's democrat party glorifies illegal immigration  vilifies the heroes of law enforcement  and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely  they want open borders  they want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country  and some of those people  some of those people are stone cold killers  some of those people  in the caravans  right  i came up with that name but they won't give me credit for that  they don't give me credit for anything  they don't give me credit for fake news  wasn't that my term  now they say  i see cnn  they said  ""fake news has reported "" no  no  you are fake news  that fake news is you  you are fake news  they turned the term around  they are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news  left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into american communities  we don't want them  in new york city  the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a- 窶ｦ the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault  after being set free the same criminal raped  brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman  they wouldn't give him to the ice warriors  their warriors  they're tough and they love our country  they're very tough and they love our country  they're taking ms-13 gang members 窶ｦ they're about as tough as you get  they're taking them out of our country by the thousands  by the thousands  that's a tough job but they love to do it  they love our country  sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong  they're immoral  and they're lethal  and they really are something that has to be stopped  they have to be stopped now  what's happening is a disgrace  thankfully here in iowa your great republican governor  sometimes referred to as governor reynolds  signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities  thank you kim  that is why we need to elect more republicans nationwide  to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states  thank you kim reynolds  you know i endorsed her  so i want to take full credit for the job she has done  i endorsed her very early  right  very early i endorsed her  i know talent  she's done a great job  democrats stand for crime  corruption  and chaos  republicans stand for law  order  and justice  it's true  we are finding the illegal game members  drug dealers  predators  and we are throwing them the hell out of our country  ideally  we don't want to put them in prison because you know what  we got to pay for them for the next 50 years  but sometimes we have to  if they're too dangerous we have no choice  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row  and they're getting lower  and lower  shockingly  as that wall gets longer  the crossings get less  remember the democrats  ""you don't need a wall  you don't need a wall  you don't need it "" seven years they all voted for it  they just didn't have the ability to build it  you know it's not easy with land  and this  and that  and property  and rights  they couldn't figure it out but i can figure it out  the problem was we couldn't get the money  but we got all the money we need now  we have everything  we have everything  the last time  this last budget  they didn't really fight us on the wall  you know why  because they learned it's a really bad issue for them  it's a really bad issue  but i made one mistake with the wall  i should have said  ""we will never ever build a wall "" they would have given me so much money to build a wall  that was my only 窶ｦ because i used to go  ""we will build the wall "" right  that was a mistake  i should have said  ""we will never ever build it  under no circumstances "" and they would have forced its building and i would have said  ""okay "" by the way  in all due respect  you know who's going to pay for the wall  right  no  no  they play 窶ｦ the fake news plays  no  no  through remittance illegal aliens from mexico are going to pay for the call  that's what it is  remittance  100% because when i say something i mean it  i said i was going to build a wall  you think it's easy when you have a party that controls the house  you got to end that  you got to end that  they said they picked up the house in '18 but i didn't run in '18  you know the big difference when you run  '16 i ran  '18 i didn't run  they did  they picked up some seats  i didn't run  but i'm running this time and we've got to take back the house  kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker of the house  kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker  watch  but getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three  getting it built is 窶ｦ honestly i don't want to brag  nobody else could have done it  nobody else could have done it  it's the real deal wall  it's the wall that border security wanted  remember i thought i could just build concrete slabs  they didn't want that because you have to be able to see through  i said  ""oh come on "" this is the expensive version  this is the best version  this is steel  and concrete  and rebar in between  it's really something  did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top  they couldn't get over  we had to get the fire department to get them down  they couldn't get over and they're like mountain climbers  they got used to climbing  they got caught because you know that panel  that's an anti-climb panel  it's very hot and very tough  it's a very hard panel to climb  the panel on top  sometimes i'd say  ""i'd rather do without that panel "" because i'm a very visual person  they said  ""sir that's anti-climb panel "" i said  ""oh it is  okay  let's put it on  to hell with it "" it's true  anti-climb panel  the wall is the top of the line  that's what they wanted  mostly 30 feet tall  that's very tall  that's maximum  it's really doing a big trick  a lot 窶ｦ wherever we have it 窶ｦ 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot  but where you have that it's incredible  99 9%  especially when we're watching it  we're watching the sections  illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring  the powerful border wall was starting to set  i mean pretty soon we'll be setting records in speed  it's going up very rapidly  very rapidly  you're seeing it all over and it's going to be really something  look  it would be nice if we didn't have to have it  it would be great  but we have to have it  they said  ""oh we could have drones "" oh what are you going to do with drones flying around  when people are going through your border with nowhere 窶ｦ they're going to have drones flying around  they know because they were all for it  they were all for it  now all of a sudden they're against  but they want drones  well we're going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall  in terms of human trafficking  people don't even talk about it  because of the internet  sadly  the worst in the history of our world  all over the world  trafficking in women and children all over the world  all over the world  the worst it's ever been  but when we have this border it makes it very  very tough for them to come into the united states with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car  the washington democrats have never been more extreme  132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' government healthcare takeover bill  it's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180 000 million great americans of your private coverage  you want that  you got great deals  you're able to negotiate  you're able to keep your doctor  keep your area  keep your hospitals  keep everything that you wanted  now they want to take it away  report to an operating room when you have a cold  okay  in your local hospital  i don't think so  180 000 million people  but i'm not going to knock it because i want bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election  okay  we are saving your healthcare while socialist democrats are trying to take away your healthcare  sleepy joe has no idea what he's even 窶ｦ he doesn't even know what he's talking about  he's so lost  honestly  that poor guys is so lost  they talk healthcare  she said  ""it's over for him "" it was over for him  actually if you knew him  a long time ago  now it's really over  we are making healthcare better and cheaper  we got rid of the individual mandate  the most unpopular thing  which essentially killed obamacare  we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will  the republican party  we're stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent  i signed it already  everything now is going to transparencies  where hospitals  doctors  everybody has to tell you how much things are costing  watch those prices come down  right  right  i have an expert on healthcare  he said transparency because it's a big deal  it's a big deal  nobody else would have gotten it done  that i can tell you  transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn't believe  people go in for a blood test  they get charged  2 700  down the road they get the same test for  57  the same exact test  maybe it's better  maybe it's better  it's crazy  when you have transparency it's all going to come  you watch  you watch  but this person  a real expert  said  ""this is bigger than healthcare "" and i got it done  unfortunately it won't really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time  they have certain statutory requirements  et cetera  well you better let me win  can you imagine  can you imagine  i did transparency  i took the guts  i did transparency and then i'm going to watch as somebody else says  ""didn't he do a great job for transparency "" you better let me win because i want the credit for that one  we're buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever  ever  ever before  we are defending your right to keep the doctor  we are defending your right to keep your plan  remember obama 28 times  ""you can keep your doctor  you can keep your doctor""  28  ""you can also keep your plan  you can keep it  you can keep it "" 28 times he lied  we should impeach him  no  he got it on a lie  he got it on a lie  but we've run it much better  but essentially it's totally different because of individual mandate  because that really took the guts out of it and we're running it much better  i had a choice  do we run it well or do we run it poorly  if we run it poorly everyone's going to blame me  if we run it well everyone's going to give him credit  especially the fakers back there right  but you know what  we got to run it well but we're coming up with a healthcare that if we win the house we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world  by far  we're fighting the lobbyists and we're fighting the special interest  in case you didn't notice  we are serving only you  thanks to our bold reforms we're now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than obamacare  we're offering a lot of different things  we have just passed  recently  10 months ago  right to try  i love right to try  you know what that is  that's people are terminally ill and they can't use medicine because 窶ｦ they've been trying to pass this  almost for 50 years  you can't use the medicine  we have the greatest doctors  labs  hospitals in the world  they come up with a medicine but it has to go through the fda procedure  right  you can't do anything  you can't use it  they won't let you use it  now i have you sign an agreement  you're not going to sue the united states  you're not going to this  your family  et cetera  et cetera  very simple  and they can use it  you have no idea the results that are taking place  you have no idea  you have no idea the results  people's lives are being 窶ｦ for me it was simple  i said  ""wait a minute  you're worried about hurting somebody  these people are dying  they're terminally ill  they're admitting they're terminally ill and you won't let them use a drug that may work  let the use the drug "" and we're letting them use the drug and it's working in a lot of cases  we have transformed veterans healthcare  including va choice  the best  you know i think i'm a totally brilliant human being  i think i'm the smartest person  so i came up with a plan  i'll never forget  i was in new hampshire  i came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying  ""sir it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare  we're waiting in line for two weeks  for four weeks  for seven weeks "" honestly people were waiting in line  they weren't very sick  they were terminally ill  truthfully  before they saw a doctor  by the time they got to the doctor  so i came up with this incredible plan  only i could think of this  i said  ""here's what you do 窶ｦ here's what you do  if somebody can't get a doctor quickly "" because we have great doctors at the va  they don't get enough credit  ""if you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside  you go locally  you get a doctor  we pay the bill  you get yourself all better "" right  so i went back  i went back and i told my people  ""do you have any idea how smart i am  listen to this plan i have "" they said  ""actually sir we've known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn't get it approved "" so i said  ""oh that's too bad  i thought it was brilliant "" but what i am good at is getting things approved and i got it approved  people are using it and it's great  i know the people of iowa don't care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare  we are combating the opioid epidemic  drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years  that's a great thing  our great first lady is helping us with that  that is such a big thing for melania  big  big thing  she is really involved  we will never let the democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants  especially when we say  ""come in  come in  we'll give you healthcare "" it's one thing they come in and it's a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying  like in california this wacky governor he says  ""come in  we're going to give you healthcare  we're going to give you free education  we're going to give you everything  we're going to give you a beautiful rolls-royce "" see to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said  ""donald trump said that the governor of california promised a rolls-royce to illegal immigrants  he didn't promise them  this was a lie and a misrepresentation by president trump "" they can't take a little humor  they can't take it  these people are sick  they're sick  no  they're sick people  them and shifty schiff is a very sick person  he lies awake at night shifting and turning  shifty  shifting and turning in his bed  sweating like a dog  ""how am i going to get him  he didn't do anything wrong  how am i going to get him "" oh what a sick guy he is  virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the moment of birth  that is why i have asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  no matter how you cut it  that's what it is  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and the late great abraham lincoln  you know that  right  abraham lincoln  honest abe  remember i always said  ""i can be more presidential than any other past president  other than perhaps abraham lincoln when he's wearing the hat "" right  because it's easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me  be a  ""good evening ladies and gentlemen  is everything okay in iowa  oh i see  the world is ripping you off  well there's not a thing i can do about that  thank you  good night everybody  good night "" no  we got to do it the right way  republicans 窶ｦ and by the way  can i be honest  doing this takes far more talent than doing that  doing that is very easy  this is not easy  especially when you just left michigan  and you just left other places  and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years  you got the maniacs for three years  i think before i came down the escalator with our future first lady i think really they were doing it then  they started even before i came down on the escalator  these people are maniacs  so you have all that  so you're fighting that and you're doing farm bills  we got your farm bill approved by the way  we got your farm bill approved  i don't even mention that because that's massive by any other standard  but it's peanuts compared to the usmca and the china deal  right  so i don't even mention it  anyway  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race  religion  color  and creed  it's true  our numbers with african american workers  people  are through the roof  are through the roof because 窶ｦ remember i used to say  ""what do you have to lose "" i'd read the down the worst on crime  the worst on education  they got this  they got that  they got 10 different things  all horrible  one day i'm in front of this tremendous group of people and i'm reading this list  african american  they have the highest crime rate  they have the highest this  they have the worst education  they have the worst schools  they have the worst 窶ｦ i said  ""stay with me "" because they were with the democrats for a hundred years  more  i said  ""stay with me  what the hell do you have to lose "" you know what  you know what  remember that  now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers  they have the best poverty numbers  they have numbers that nobody would believe  they're doing so great  it's so great to see it  it's incredible  youth unemployment  african american youth  it's been great  we're asking all americans to join our incredible movement  we are a big tent and a big party with big  bold  beautiful ideas for the future  we're what the country was based on originally  it was called greatness  it was called greatness  during national school choice week  school choice everybody  we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools  iowa became one of the first states to pass school choice  that was over 10 years ago  now governor reynolds  senator ernst  senator grassley  and more than 100 members of congress are supporting our plan to give school choice to every child in america who needs it  it's a great plan  to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform  think of that  think of that  we had a lot of great conservatives who wanted it  we had liberals who wanted it  they couldn't get it passed  president obama couldn't even come close  he didn't try too hard  he talked like  ""oh i'll try "" to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges  a record  who will interpret the constitution as one  and two great supreme court justices  by the way  as part as 窶ｦ right  two great ones  as part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an  8 5 million facility to support our iowa guardsmen at camp dodge  right here in des moines  iowa  right here  camp dodge  camp dodge everybody  we take care of camp dodge  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace  we're going to see if we can get that done  it's one of the toughest deals of all  one of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country  they apologized  they would say  ""i'm sorry "" now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of iowa  we are standing up for iowa  at stake in our present battle is the survival  frankly  of our nation  look  i can make this speech really short  all i have to do is say  ""hello iowa  you have no choice  you have to vote for me  otherwise everything that you've built in your entire life will be gone  goodbye iowa  have a good time "" instead i work my ass off up here  okay  yeah  true  do you think this is easy  it's a little hot in this room  this room wasn't designed for this many people  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020  we have to  by the way  for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children 窶ｦ because of our great tax bill  the biggest tax cut in the history of our country  the biggest that you benefit by  because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax  as they call it  so i always say  ""if you love your children that's a great thing  if you don't love your children don't leave it to them and that particular tax won't matter "" but if you love 窶ｦ is there anybody here that does not love your children  is there anybody here who loves your children  well it's iowa  it's iowa  you love your children  you know you have no tax to pay  you leave your   no  it's great  so when you're looking down at your children you're saying  ""oh did you get lucky  did you get lucky  look at them  they're enjoying life "" but only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  that swamp is bad  that swamp is bad  i had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated  it's a degenerate swamp  i had no idea  when i came out  i said  ""we're going to drain this swamp "" i had no idea that the swamp was that evil  but we're winning  we're winning because we're in the white house  we're winning  with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependents to independents  and poverty to prosperity  that's what's happening all over our country  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  it's already happening  we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made  raised  farmed  and grown right here in the usa  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years  we've already started  should have been started in the last administration  incredible  should have been started earlier  but we started  in less than 10 years  the aids epidemic will be eradicated  will be gone  who would have thought that was possible  when they came in and told me that a couple of years ago  i said  ""really  nobody knows that "" incredible the strides that we've made  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms  in the state of virginia they want to take your guns away  you believe it  virginia  i love virginia  of all states  they want to take your guns away  the democrats  not going to happen  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we are one great america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that family and faith  not government

8,19,Sep,2020,datasets/Fayetteville,"what a crowd  what a crowd  get those people over here  see me  let them come over  what is a big crowd  it's always big  we want to win  we got to win  we want to save our country from the radical left  the radical left crazies  thank you very much  and hello  north carolina  hello  north carolina  we love you  north carolina  i'm thrilled to be in fayetteville with thousands of loyal  hard working american patriots  and you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now  and you're watching those polls  they go up  up  up up  45 days from now  we're going to win north carolina  we're going to win four more years in the white house  as we meet tonight  our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant supreme court justice  ruth bader ginsburg  her landmark rulings  fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all americans  you may agree  you may not disagree with her  but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people  i say  all americans justice ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours  a friend of mine  justice scalia  is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency  dignity  and respect  our thoughts and prayers are with her family  thank you very much  so article ii of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the supreme court  i don't think it can be any more clear  can it  i don't think so  i don't think so  what do you think  thom  thom tillis  i don't think it can be any more clear  this can only happen in north carolina  i hope you hear that back home  look at all that press  that's a lot of press  that's a lot of fake news  well  i hope they hear  so the chant  this is a new one  fill that seat  this is the chant  this can only happen to me  fill that seat  now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat  right  and that's what we're going to do  we're going to fill the seat  with a great hat  i want to try one of those hats  i love that  no  think of it  29 times  every single time nobody said  ""oh  let's not fill the seat "" we won the election  now then we have some senators that  forget it  think of it  i won't say it  i won't say it  susan  i won't say it  susan  but thom tillis is with us  i can tell you that  great  we have great republican senators  we have great people and we have a great country  that's really  we have a great country  and we're going to keep it that way  so we win an election and those are the consequences  it's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing  the supreme court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where  by the way  i didn't run  we had a lot of people  a lot of people said  ""oh  he really took a little bit of a shellacking "" not nearly as bad as others  in fact  we gained seats in the senate  but they never talk about that  they don't talk about that  we gained two seats  nobody talked about it  but we didn't run  and i had a lot of people that  ""sir  we'll never vote in 2018 "" i said  ""no  no vote  everybody vote  they just didn't  i think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on  you see what's happening  you see the enthusiasm that we have  which  by the way  we set a record in 2016  the bad news for the democrats is we are more enthusiastic now  not even close  than we were in 2016  we are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we're rounding the turn  we're rounding the corner of the pandemic  but we're having them outside  and we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on  it's called a protest  we are protesters  we're going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these  let's call them blue states  we want to be nice  we're going to call it a protest against stupidity  so we are going to have protests against stupidity  and pennsylvania  look what they're doing in pennsylvania  a great state  that's actually something very special is going to happen here  in pennsylvania  that's a commonwealth  we always have to remember pennsylvania  commonwealth  got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble  but we love pennsylvania  and it's a shut down  the governor's got it just shut down nice and tight  and you know what  on november 4th  it's going to be opened up  because they're trying to hurt our numbers  but our economic numbers are so good  they're staggering  they're the best we've ever had  jobs  retail  stock  market  everything  and this is with a lot of shutdowns by democrats  that's all they're doing  on november 4th  they'll announce  ""we've decided to open up "" one of the teachers groups said  actually  one of the unions and one of the politicians in california said  ""no  we're not going to do it  we need to do it  we should be open by november 4th "" that was not a good thing for them to say  that person i think was fired  i think was fired  in both the 2016 and the 2018 elections  the american people chose a president and a senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the constitution as written  both the white house and the senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters  and that is exactly what we're going to do  we said that if for any reason  we have a vacancy on the united states supreme court  we will fill that vacancy  we're not going to say  and by the way  we have plenty of time  there's a lot of time  you're talking about january 20th  so we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  i won't be putting forth a nominee next week  it will be a woman  it will be a woman unless  wait  okay  let's do a poll  oh  there they are  how many of these have you come to  speaking of women  how many of  what is this number one  like 90  they're great  north carolina  though  i see them all over the place  they're great  anyway  i hope your husbands are okay with it  are they okay  they're okay  you have good husbands  but we're going to do a vote  so i said  i love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as i'm concerned  if we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now  but we're actually getting very good  we just had a 53 from rasmussen  which is very good  considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53  history has shown that when you're at 53 you can't lose an election  has anyone ever lost an election with a 53  the answer is yes  when the other side cheats  that could happen  that could happen  that could happen  you saw what happened in pennsylvania  some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots  that means i'll be leading and winning pennsylvania like we did last time  yeah  yeah  we'll be leading  we'll be winning pennsylvania  we're going to win it easy  we're going to win your state easily  and deb  what a great  she's doing such a good job  but mark  just a few months ago  i've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know  really  i mean really great  does everyone know madison  yes  you're going to vote for madison  he's great  he's a great guy  but mark had a beautiful head of black hair and i just noticed that hair's turning white very fast  but we're doing a job  we're very close to a great deal with tiktok  tiktok but nobody cares about that anymore  all they care about is fill that seat  right  until about 24 hours ago  that's all they talked about is tiktok  tiktok  we have a deal worked out  i think with walmart is going to buy it along with oracle  larry ellison  it's going to be an incredible combination  and i said  ""do me a favor  could you put up  5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country  the real history  not the fake history "" because we're getting very close to that deal  and all of the technology will be maintained here  they're going to move probably to the great state of texas  sorry  we got you a lot of business when it came窶ｦ but they're going to move into the united states  which is what's important  they're moving to the united states  unbelievable company  they're going to have 25 000 jobs  if it all goes  i gave them the preliminary approval  but they're putting up  5 billion  and my only problem is they did it so fast  i should have asked for more  what happened is when i suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said  senators  congressmen  women  everybody  they said  ""you can't do that  that's never been done "" that's the problem  nothing's ever been done  and we had other companies  a lot of people wanted it  and i said  ""you got to put up  5 million either to the treasury of the united states maybe or into some education fund or do something "" and they were sort of agreeing with me  they thought it was okay  and then i went to the legal legals here and i said  ""they're going to put up  5 million  give it to the united states "" ""sir you can't do that  there's no provision "" i said  ""how the hell can there be no provision  we're making the deal possible  why can't they give us  5 billion dollars "" that's b  that's a lot of money  now  watch the crazy democrats  they'll go  ""they should have gotten more money "" it's never been done before  they should have  no matter what you do  they should have gotten more  schumer and nancy pelosi  crazy nancy  but i'll tell you  and i said it last night  we had a great rally  last night  you saw that in a place that we're going to win  we're going to win minnesota  hasn't been won since 1972  and they're all saying  ""well  we did give them back the big iron ore range "" it was  obama took it away with the stroke of a pen  he put everybody out of work  we gave it back  but i'll tell you what  we're going to have a victory on november 3rd  the likes of which you've never seen  now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins  not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later  but in just three and a half years under my administration  we've secured america's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the u s military  think of that  and i shouldn't say this and the fake news keeps going  ""oh  he's given away classified information "" no i'm not  we are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before  and i said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where  ""he's giving away confidential information "" these people are crazy  no  no  i'm just telling you that- crazy  no  no  i'm just telling you that president putin and president xi of china  russia  china  north korea  everybody  they are so envious of what we're doing  they can't even believe it  if they know  they perhaps don't know  under obama  they knew immediately  okay  under us  but we are building weapons  all made in the usa  the likes of which no country has ever seen before  and hope to god  we never have to use them  that's the key  i don't ever want to use them  remember  i was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week  remember that  where's the war  we're taking them out of afghanistan  we're almost finished with that  working along well  we're taking them out of syria  other than i left some behind for the oil  we kept the oil  is it okay that we kept the oil  is it okay we kept the oil  let's go back to my poll  ready  so we're putting  i think it should be a woman  because i actually like women much more than i like men  i have to say  no  i do  i do  i like women more  so i have to make a decision  to fill the seat  as we say  we should have a new campaign  let's make a t-shirt  fill the seat  okay  my people are so good  tomorrow  it'll be all over the place  that's a good idea  that's a good idea  fill the seat  okay watch this  so good tomorrow you'll see them all over the place  fill the seat  i don't know how the hell they do it  but they get it done fast  you remember i said  where's hunter  where's hunter  the next day  it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is hunter  what the hell ever happened  he took the money and he ran i think  where's hunter  he took the money  he went to china  he took 1 5 billion  he had no experience  he didn't have a job until this guy became vice president  then he went to china  he got  1 5 billion  i asked the head of a great company  blackstone  one of the biggest in the world  i said  ""steve  let me ask you a question  is that possible "" ""no  that's never done "" china doesn't do that  well  how did a guy with no experience do this  he said  ""very simple  his father's vice president "" is that what you want  and then ukraine   183 000 a month  and a  3 million upfront payment for him and his friends  think of this  with no experience and no job  and they said  do you know energy  it's an energy company that paid it  do you know energy  no  i don't  i've not familiar with the subject  our great congressman  right  how the hell does this happen  i think it will be brought up into debate  i think it will be brought up in the debate  i think  where is hunter  where is hunter  you know where hunter is  he's probably on the riviera having a very good time  he's giving some great energy advice  he's learning  he's taking a night class on energy for 180 grand  where is hunter  they're corrupt  remember joe with a prosecutor    1 billion  i'm not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said  that crazy company over in ukraine   1 billion  i'm not giving it  you get them out  and guess what  they got them out  here's your billion dollars  now that's called quid pro quo  right  that's the real deal  with us  there was none  they made it up  remember when shift made the phony speech  eight times he said the same thing  except that's not what happened  fortunately  we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word  every word  i'm glad we had them because we're dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people  so women and men  ready  would you rather have a woman on the supreme court or would you rather have a man  ready  a woman or a man  so  would you rather have me choose  this is a very scientific poll  actually  it's a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed  then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don't interview the people  they sit behind their desk  would you rather have a woman on the supreme court  yes  woman  yes  tom tiller says yes  or would you rather have a man on the supreme court  what's going on  let's give it one more quick chance  this is a free poll  and this is a lot of people  this is tens of thousands of people  this is a lot of people  you know  the fake news  they'll say  ""he had a smattering of people "" if bernie sanders had a crowd  oh  he had a massive crowd  it was so big  with me  my crowds are five times bigger than bernie's  and they'll say  ""he had a smattering of people "" they were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of  thousands  if those people  come on  bring them over  what the hell  at this point  might as well  let them come on over  come on over  you got thousands of people behind these people  i would imagine the sight lines aren't too good  you have stands in front  okay  so one more time  who would rather have a man on the supreme court  who would have a woman on the supreme  now tomorrow  like fake news  cnn  he was playing games with the united states  it is a terrible thing he's done  no  i'm just taking a poll  please  and by the way  that's a very accurate poll  because that's the way i feel  it will be a woman  a very talented  very brilliant woman  who i haven't chosen yet  but we have numerous women on the list  i built this incredible list of brilliant people  and we're asking for biden's list  he can't give it  you know why  because if he ever gave a list  he'd either put somebody in the left middle  which would be okay  you could get votes  or he'd put one  somebody  which is what he's going to choose  so far left  now  if he did the left middle  he loses his entire left coast  right  and if he loses the left coast  that's the end of his election  and last time  remember how many people i got from bernie  because of trade  a lot of the bernie people vote for us because bernie is right about one thing  trade  but bernie took a bad defeat  didn't he  it was a bad loss  he's one of the most gracious losers i've ever seen  he is  all elizabeth warren  pocahontas had to do is leave  if she left before super tuesday  bernie would have won every one of those states  but they split up that vote  that's too bad  but we have sleepy joe  we'll see how that works out  i think it's working out pretty good  we were winning so much  we didn't even have  we could have called off the election  we were winning by so much  and then the plane came in from china  and in many ways  i had to go back to work  but i had to go back to work on this one too  and now we're going up and up and up and we're winning and we're winning all over the place  because i happen to think  i just say what i want  and you know  they make up a lot of false stories  they will make up a lie  like what i said about military  can you imagine  no animal would say that  they make it up and then they put it in ads  so once they did that  the only good thing is i can say  i said  ""now i can say anything "" he is the worst candidate  the dumbest of all candidates  but he was dumb in prime time  as told to me by a senator from long ago  he said  ""who's the dumbest in the senate  who's the smartest in the senate "" the smartest is  i won't tell you  but the dumbest is joe  i said  ""who's joe "" he said  ""joe biden "" that was 25 years ago  that was in prime time  he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics  if i lose to him  i don't know what i'm going to do  i will never speak to you again  you'll never see me again  no  how do you lose  he is honestly  i go up and these guys are grilling me all the time  stephanopoulos grill  grill  okay  it's all right  it's okay  i think it came out very  well it's always  it comes out well  you have to be able to answer  they're very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries  leaders of foreign countries  but i say he's always using a teleprompter  i don't care if he uses a teleprompter  you know what bothers me  that means the fake news is giving him the questions  so that's what really窶ｦ they never gave me the questions  if i ever said  in fact  i'm going to say it now  i want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me  and i'm going to read the questions off the teleprompter  and the questions are so easy  did you see anderson cooper  he's a nice guy  he's interviewed me over the years  a lot  but he's a tough interviewer  did you see those softballs  what do you think donald trump is a very bad human being  do you agree with that  yes  i do  anderson  i've never seen softballs  and actually they're getting hit by it  they're getting hit by it  it's just a terrible thing  i mean  this is a guy  i used to call him 1% joe  because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%  in fact  he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left  that means less than one  now he's shot  he's got half of his head left  and he's out  think of it  he's totally shot  and he ends up getting the nomination  he couldn't get it in prime time  what the hell is going on with the world today  what's going on  what's going on with the world  mark meadows  unbelievable meadows  oh boy  he's a smart guy  meadows  great  great guy  north carolina  in just three and a half years  we obliterated the isis caliphate  remember when i had it down to 99%  they said  ""you got to finish it "" i said  ""let somebody else finish it "" and we went  and we finished it  we fixed our disastrous trade deals  which we have  china's now paying us billions and billions of dollars  but you know  i view it differently now  i view china much differently now  after the plague came in  i view it differently  and we brought your jobs back home to north carolina and our contract  in three years of president trump  real median household income rose by almost  7 000  now think of that  three years  three years  right  achieving the highest median income in the history of our country  this is in three years  under 16 years of presidents  barack hussein obama  ladies and gentlemen  is president barack hussein obama  or as rush limbaugh  the great  how great is rush  do we love rush  as rush limbaugh would say  barack hussein obama  you ever hear rush  barack hussein obama  rush is great  he's doing well too  he's great  he's a tough guy  we love rush  we love you rush  he watches every one of these rallies  you know  he supported me when i came down with our great first lady  i came down the escalator  i made a speech  i didn't even have a speech writer  i had to wing it  the winging speeches are the best ones like last night  but rush said  ""i like that guy  i'd never heard that before  i'd never heard we're going to build a wall "" we're going to have secure borders  we're going to make new trade deals that are like sane  we're going to do all the things we're going to rebuild our military  we're going to have a strong country again  we did so many things  and rush heard this  i didn't know rush  i mean  maybe i met him once  twice  for two seconds  and he became an instant fan of trump  and he was for a long time before i even got to know him  and he's been so important  he's the king  39 million listeners  there's nobody like him  try sitting down for what is it  three hours  and talking  just talking with everyone  39 million people  often  try sitting  we love rush  i love rush  but listen  try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening  and talk for three hours without phone calls  phone calls are easy  hey  what do you think of this  what do you think  just talk  talk  and everybody finds it fascinating  and it is fascinating  i wish i had time to listen more often  it's a little tough as president  but everybody finds it fascinating  and we gave rush  because he's such an important person and done such an incredible job the presidential medal of freedom  and catherine  his wife is great  what a couple  but rush has been unbelievable  he's so on our side  and he was from literally day one  right from the beginning  and we don't have to mention sean  and laura  and so many others  we don't have to mention lou  the great lou dobbs  right  i mean  lou dobbs said  lou started years ago  and he liked us from the beginning  he said  ""donald trump is going to be a very good president "" okay  that was the first little time  then he went  ""donald trump  i love donald trump  but he's the best since ronald reagan "" then he went  ""donald trump is an even better president than ronald reagan "" so that was about a year and a half into it  then the great lou dobbs said  ""donald trump may be the greatest of all time  greatest of all time "" and then somebody said  ""can i ask you lou  when you say the greatest  does that include abraham lincoln and george washington "" he said  ""absolutely  he's now the greatest of all time "" so we love lou dobbs  lou dobbs is great  go out and buy his book  his book is great  but we have great support  we have great support  tucker's been very good lately  i have to tell you  tucker has been very good  tucker carlson  he's come a long way  actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history  he's very strong in that  we took care of that very powerfully  very powerfully  we signed an executive order  we fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff  that were getting paid a lot of money that we're here for a long time  under 16 years of presidents obama and bush  the median income only rose  2 900  now think of that  so three years  it went up  7 000  16 years  it went up less than  3 000  i'd say that's a big difference  and that's not including energy  because look what you're paying for your gasoline now  right  remember those days  remember those days of  5  you said  ""let's get rid of that big truck "" now you're all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible  you know why  because gasoline is so damn cheap  right  remember the  5 days  now you're below  2 a lot  right  below two  i mean  they're seeing numbers that nobody believes  it's all good stuff  and we're energy independent  so many things have happened  if you add four or  5 000  so you're talking about by  11 000  you got to add the energy  i said to my people  ""put the energy in "" ""well  i don't know if it's right "" i said  ""do me a favor  just put it in "" in my first three years  we lifted 6 6 million people out of poverty  the largest poverty reduction of any president in american history  we built the greatest economy in the history of the world  and now we're doing it again  and we're doing it very rapidly  this is a super v  they said  ""oh  i don't know  v is going to be very hard "" no  this is a super v  we will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year  it's already in very good shape  very  very good shape  in a matter of weeks  we will end the pandemic from china  we will end our plague from china  next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country  it's heading that way  if you take a look  automobile manufacturing  housing  retailing  they're all setting records  they're through the roof  hard to believe  actually  during the rounding the corner  when i say rounding the corner  they go crazy  they want to keep it going as long as possible  if you say anything positive  they say  ""he's not telling the truth to the american public "" i am actually telling the truth  you know these people  they talked about  because i said  ""well  winston churchill was a great leader "" they said the other night  ""you said winston churchill was a great leader  but he didn't lie "" because this guy  woodward  he writes a book  he's had it  he's another one shot  i compare him sort of to biden  he's sharper than biden  i have to say that  but he's shot  he's tired  he's exhausted  i never saw a guy be able to do so much television  try doing a book on somebody else  see how much television time they give you  like none  but they said the other night  and it was amazing  winston churchill  they said  ""he didn't lie to the people  to britain  he didn't lie "" i said  ""well  let me ask you this  he stood on buildings when the nazis  hitler  were bombing london "" that's pretty brave  because he may have been doing a little drinking  but he was known for that  right  he's got a right to  but it's true  he stood in the buildings in london  as they were bombing london  and made speeches  and made statements  and had everything  and he'd sometimes have press conferences  and the fake news wouldn't show up  he was standing there  nobody was in front of him  but he would stand there  and he would say  ""you are safe  you are safe  everything is okay  you are safe "" well  that's a lie  i guess  right  so i said  ""oh  i never thought of it that way  i guess he lied "" no  he's a great leader  and he was leading  and he was a great  great prime minister  he did a fantastic job  not lying  no  we love our country  we want to lead our country  and we can't let a thing like this  this is a horrible  horrible thing that happened to the world it happened  should have been stopped in china  they stopped it from going into the rest of china  should have been stopped in china  to defeat the china virus  we launched the largest industrial mobilization since world war ii  somebody said  ""what grade would you give yourself "" i said  ""a+ "" but i would give myself a d  i would say i would give myself  and my whole group  because mike pence is great  mike pence really was  he worked so hard  and it's unfair  he worked so hard  the ventilators  the vaccines  the therapeutics now we have  look at what's happening  when somebody gets very sick  look how we bring them back so often  compared to what it was originally  i mean  the work that's been done  and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what's going on  but the democrats don't want the vaccine  they don't want it  at first  they wanted a vaccine  because they didn't think it could happen  now that we have it  they're going like  ""well  we don't want it "" it's the craziest thing  think of it  you want to get a vaccine  and they're willing to hurt people  let people die for political reasons  think of it  i think  honestly  i think it's a disgrace  but we surged rapid testing kits  we have more testing than all other  i mean  practically everybody  you look at number two is india  they have 1 5 billion people  we are up 50 million tests more than india  in fact  we're about to crack 100 million tests  and when you test  then you have  does this make sense  then you have cases  so we do all this testing  and i come home and i turn on nbc news  it is so bad  i think nbc  that's not only msdnc  i think nbc with lester holt  there's another beauty  hi lester  how do you feel big in second place lester  he surged from first place to second place  but nbc news is so  i mean  it's just terrible  they use free airwaves  and then they give you fake news  free airwaves  they should pay a lot of money for this  this is not right  nbc  it's owned by a company called concast  c-o-n  concast  they're con  they're con men  it's a disgrace  they spend fortunes on public relations and then i get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world  i guess  yeah  the world  it's all over the world  and i say concast  and immediately  there goes their public  how's your public relations doing nbc  not too good  but they're just窶ｦ they don't tell the truth  our country would be so much better off if we had honest media  really  really would  and do you see what their approval rating has gone to  i think it's one of my greatest achievements  hey look- it's a saturday night  we have all night  this happened last night in minnesota  i have these teleprompter people  they're great  they're genius  and i was about 45 minutes into the speech  and i realized i was only on line two  and he was like  ""what do i do "" but we have more fun  hey  you now have a president that doesn't have to use a teleprompter  isn't that nice  and i said last night  i said  and yeah  your friends were there  the congressmen  by the way  is the media now  and i'm pretty sure it's getting close  i think they have a lower approval rating than congress  congratulations  no  but it's hard  when you're sitting there  you're in businesses  you're in construction  you drive trucks  you do a lot of things  you're in offices  you don't realize  because you don't know what's happening  i know exactly a true story  and then it's written to totally bend the truth  to make a good thing into a bad thing  like  can you believe it  in one week they nominated me  not for one  but for two nobel prizes  no  but think of it  no but think  and they didn't cover the story  now obama got his the first week  very liberal group  and nobody knew what the hell he got it for  and he didn't know  why did you get it  i don't know  remember  i don't know  i have no idea  but you know  you have a president  you love your president  and your president gets honored  because i'm not being honored  you're being honored with the nobel peace prize  for israel  what we did with israel  i went home and i said to the first lady  ""darling "" she's very popular  she made a great speech  right  and ivanka made a great speech  right  but i went home  i said  ""darling  i have big news tonight  let's turn on the television "" you know  we don't use wind  we use actually  we actually use petroleum  we use petro  because we like it to be on like a lot  we don't like to have lots of open gaps when the wind's not blowing  we can't watch president trump  i go home  i say  ""first lady  a great thing happened today  i was honored  nobel peace prize  nominated  this is a big thing first lady "" and then i went home two days later  i said  ""first lady  you're not going to believe it  i was honored again  nobel prize  that's kosovo "" israel  kosovo  i said  ""first lady  this is great news  let's turn on the television  this is going to be big  this is going to be big tonight  we just got honored  this is big "" nobel peace  can you imagine  you grow up in brooklyn  queens  and now you're getting the窶ｦ ""first lady  let's turn on the television  let's turn onto that fake nbc news "" and i see we have a storm  ""okay  first lady  don't worry about it  the storm is big  we have it taken care of  fema's down there  florida  alabama  georgia  we got fema down there  it's being taken care of  we always take care of it  we take good care of it "" texas  louisiana  we took good care of him two weeks ago  ""all right first lady  don't worry about it  it's the next story  i'm sure  it's the nobel prize for peace "" we're stopping mass killings between kosovo and serbia  they've been killing each other for so many  they're going to stop killing  i said  fellas  let's get together  they'd been doing it for hundreds of years  frankly  under different names  i said  that's great  and with israel  uae and bahrain signed a deal with israel  everybody said it couldn't be done  i said  ""all right  first lady  that's the first story on nbc  but don't worry  that's a big story  the floods are big  i see it "" and then there was a second story about something  and then their third story is about something with me  i don't know  something bad they found out  then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth  i said  ""first lady  i'm a little embarrassed  i thought we'd do a little better "" and then they looked at the screen  and said  ""good night "" and i wasn't covered  i got the nobel peace prize nomination  a peace prize  nobel nomination  and they didn't cover it  and then the following day i watched a certain show that does like us  and they said  ""would you believe  that they covered  and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing  that was 18 minutes  and the peace prize nobel version  zero time for president trump  thank you very much fake news media  we appreciate it  and when obama got it  here are the headlines  president obama gets the nobel prize  we need an honest media  the free airwaves  they lie over the free airwaves  they use them and they lie  i don't know  we're going to have to look at it  they're a bunch of scoundrels  they hate it when i say it  but you know  honestly  they are the enemy of the people  when they lie  they are the enemy of the people  you are the enemy of the people  oh  damn it  the red lights just went off  one  two  three  there's one back there  there's one back there  probably  oh it's oan  thank you oan  every time i get on this subject  they cover me not because they want to  but we get great ratings  we get ratings  these little deals that we have here  come on in folks  come on in  look at these people  but you know what  i'll tell you what  it's true  they cover it because窶ｦ but anytime i start talking about the fake news media  you see them getting a little tentative  the camera starts to shake a little bit  and you know  there's another thing  look at this crowd  it's as far as the eye can see  it's a big crowd  right  they never cover it  i said to my wife last night  we had this incredible crowd  a lot of people  thousands and thousands  i mean like 25  30 000  many people outside couldn't get it  it was like a sea of people  my wife said  ""was it a large crowd "" i said  ""did you watch "" ""yes  but they only show your face "" and i saw people they never show  and that includes fox  which has changed a lot  changed a lot  sad  somebody said  ""what's the biggest difference between 2016 and now "" you know what i said  ""fox "" biggest difference  biggest difference  i don't know what's going on with them  but we have some great ones too on fox  we surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in america  we learned a lot  through pioneering therapies  we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since april  think of that  85%  we've come up with things  they're waiting to see what's coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics  which to me is even more important than the vaccine  you go into the hospital  you make people better  you give them a shot  you do a transfusion  you make people better  they walk out  that's to me even better  but ultimately long-term  those vaccines are going to be great  and they're really working out well and it's going to be really soon  the people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible  as long as possible  they're going to try and give sleepy joe the credit  he doesn't even know what a窶ｦ it's possible  they're going to try and get sleepy joe the credit  he doesn't even know what a vaccine is  europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the united states  does anyone know that  they don't report that  right  europe  europe's had a hard time  i'm not looking to hurt them  but they have 30% higher  our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs  including 1 3 million jobs  and a wonderful place called north carolina  right  when i banned travel from china in january  sleepy joe biden called it  ""that's hysterical  that's xenophobic "" what does that mean  tell me what xenophobic means  sleepy joe  who said that  i mean  you're my friend  who said it  all right  what a voice  have you ever tried opera  what a voice  did everybody hear that  that's true  i wouldn't say it  she said  ""he has no idea where he is "" but i would never say it  i won't say it  i won't say it  i refuse this  no  but don't underestimate him  look  he's been doing this for 47 years  and i got a debate coming up with this guy  no  it's true  you never know  you never know  they give him a big fat shot in the ass  and he comes out  and for two hours  he's better than ever before  problem is what happens after the 窶ｦ no  we're going to ask for a drug test  we are  i'd like to have a drug test  both of us  i'll take it  he'll take  because i watched him into debates with all those people  those democrats  the one who treated him worst was kamala  actually  also  she was the one that treated  you know that  she was the one that treated him so badly  and she treated kavanaugh very badly too  nobody was ever ruder  nobody ever suffered  like justice kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people  the way he was tortured was disgraced  and they had nothing  those women  that was all made up  most of them have already admitted  it was all made up lies  false accusations  and they made him suffer  and the leader of the pack i would say was  kamala was the worst  and pocahontas was a close second  how's pocahontas doing  since she destroyed bloomberg  how about bloomberg  did he get killed  now he's trying to come back  he's trying to buy his way back into the democratic party  ""i'm going to put up  100 million in florida  we're going to go "" he wants to be back so badly  here's a guy who spent  2 billion  it's almost two billion now  they're finding out  he had some of the dumbest advisers  people i know  some of the dumbest people  if he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads  he could have won  he could have won  unfortunately  he said  ""no  i want to debate "" he went and sued to get into the debates  that was not a good lawsuit  they settled by saying  ""we'll let you in the debate "" the first question  he was destroyed  you would think that  the way the democrats treated him  he would really come to me  and he'd say  ""i want you "" but his hatred and jealousy 窶ｦ he wanted to be president  but he doesn't have the capability of being president  but he's going down now to florida  he's going to spend  100 million  how good 窶ｦ i have to say this  i'm not a fan of elizabeth warren  i gave her the name pocahontas  i thought that was the end  remember what i used to say about her  she has 窶ｦ oh  well  you know it  you know  i would just  look  i said  ""this is not an indian "" she said  ""i'm an indian "" you remember what i said  ""i have more indian blood than me  i have more in me than she has  and i have none "" unfortunately  i'd like to have some  i would like to have some  i think it could help  it might make me better  but i have none  and i said  ""i have more than she does "" and then she went out to  and she choked  remember that  she went out  and she took a test  and it found out that about 700 years ago  there was a possible event  1 024th  right  wasn't that it  good memory  very good memory  trump has a good memory  good moment  not for that  but for a lot of things  now  1024th  which meant many  many  many centuries ago  there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line  but she choked  we forced her into a choke  she went down like a rock  and then she started coming up  up  up  up  up  then she totally destroyed mike bloomberg  we call him mini mike  remember  mini mikey wants that platform  ""i want a platform  damn it "" i don't mind  oh  boy  he was pathetic  but now he's going to try and buy his way back into the democrat party  you remember that guy  great environmentalist  except he made his money with coal  which is okay  i think coal is good  clean coal  i like clean coal  if we had listened to joe biden  hundreds of thousands more americans would have died  you know that  he was way behind  this was months later  and then i watch him last night  reading something saying that  i opened  i closed it up  one week later  one week  two months later  he was talking about the fact that i shouldn't be doing that to china  i shouldn't be banning china because i was xenophobic  and it's just unbelievable  and now they will say anything  it's called disinformation  they will make up a lie  they will make up a story  and they go with it  it makes no difference whether or not it's show  and they'll take ads  it's the worst group of people  he's surrounded by bad people  dishonest people  but they're very smart  he's not smart  they keep him from talking  it's actually  if he wins  it's the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world  because they took a man who's got nothing  he didn't have it  but he's got nothing  and i will give them credit  the single greatest campaign in history  if he wins  but you know what  if he wins  north carolina is screwed  and so is every place else  and you can forget your tobacco industry  you can forget your farmers  i gave the farmers  28 billion  thank you very much  presidency   28 billion  because you were targeted  right  you were targeted by china  and i said  ""how much were the farmers "" iowa  nebraska  you  all of them  you were targeted  i said  ""how much "" sonny perdue  i said  ""how much  secretary "" 12 billion  then 16 billion  you were targeted  i took it out of the tariffs we charge  we never took 25 cents in from china  now we're getting billions and billions and billions of dollars  sleepy joe  that never gave  never took anything  or trump  misjudging him  so mexico  we're driving them a little crazy  they don't like trump too much  but now biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine  his campaign campaign's really reckless  and all it is is for political reasons  it's political reasons  biden  his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown  we're getting better  we're really coming along  and he's talking about shutting down  we're not doing any shutdowns  we don't need shutdowns  maybe a little area  if it's such a spike  we understand  we have to take care of our senior citizens  this guy talked  he said  ""well  i'll do whatever my medical people want  i believe in science "" he doesn't know what science is  ""i believe in science "" no  we're not doing any shutdowns  we don't need  we're rounding the turn  without the vaccine  we're rounding the turn  with the vaccine  it'll just speed it up  that's another one that will be controversial  they'll say  ""he's saying that it's happened "" yeah  without the care  without the vaccine  it's going along  with a vaccine  even better  it'll be faster  biden's own chief of staff said  when they manage the h1n1 that he calls the n1h1  right  he goes  ""the n1h1 "" and that's an easy one  because h comes before  but he always gets it wrong  it's like  seven times  ""it's great to be with the great people of iowa "" they'll say  ""sir  you're in idaho "" ""oh "" i've never made that mistake so far  but i always say  ""if you do  just leave the stage  because you can never recover "" you can speak as well as  i mentioned  winston churchill  even though he was a great speaker  he was a stutterer  and he became one of the greatest speakers ever  you could be winston churchill  if you make that mistake  just leave the stage  you can't recover  but he's made it oftentimes  right  in new hampshire  and it was vermont  the worst  i think  i think there was one  he was in ohio  and he said he was in florida  right  but he couldn't find any palm trees  we just got a poll from ohio  through the roof  great state of ohio  good governor  great state of ohio  but when they managed the h1n1 swine flu  this was from his top person that ran it  ""we did every possible thing wrong  60 million americans got h1n1 in that period of time  and it was just a total disaster "" he basically said  ""we didn't know what the hell we were doing "" and this is the guy that's going to tell us what to do with something that's much more lethal  much more lethal  this is much more lethal than the swine flu  if h1n1 had the same fatality rate as the china virus  over two million people would have already perished  they didn't know what the hell they were doing  and the guy admitted it  that guy can not be very popular in democrat politics right there  but just to remember  and he's telling us how to do things  we're building ventilators  we're the ventilator capital of the world now  think of it  we're sending them to other countries  we have so many  and we have made a lot of governors look very good  and they all admit it  until the press comes in front  where they say  ""oh  he was okay "" but we took care of them  we took care of governors  we took care of the states  on november 3rd  north carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity  or whether we allow joe biden to impose a  4 trillion tax hike  ban american energy  confiscate your guns  these are all things that he said  shut down our economy  destroy the suburbs  they were saying that women in the suburbs  they're not sure if they like me  they're starting to like me a lot lately  because it's law and order  they want law and order  thank you  a suburbanite  thank you  thank you  no  it's true  i don't know  but i heard the same thing four years ago  remember  "" women will not vote for him "" then we win the election  it's like  they're all in shock  well  what took place  ""well  he did very well with women "" what the hell was that all about  right  did very well  women were great  now  if it holds true 窶ｦ there a lot of jobs  a lot of jobs  a lot of great thinking  but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens  now  what that's going to do is destroy our country  because two things happen  number one  we can't afford it  number two  everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that  right now  they're saying  wherever they are  when you say  ""we're going to give you free education  we're going to give you free healthcare  we're going to take care of you  everything's going to be perfect  we're going to give you  every single family "" now watch  they'll print this  ""we've checked it out  and he lied about this "" every single family is going to be given a brand new silver cloud rolls royce  now  i said that  and cnn went  ""he lied about the fact that they're not getting a rolls royce "" remember what i said  "" russia  if you're listening "" in front of this message  ""russia  if you're listening  find out where her e-mails "" or whatever  and then  everybody laughed  i laughed  well  they actually play it all the time  ""when he spoke to russia "" do you ever see it  and they cut it off before the end  they don't see any  i said  ""russia  if you're listening 窶ｦ"" oh  these people are sick  he wants to erase your borders  yeah  that was supposed to be a joke  right  it was a joke  it was a joke  everybody was laughing  but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second  he wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in education  to combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools  i am launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called  1776 commission  it's already done  that's good  and it's true  your kids come home  and they tell you things  how many of you  the kids come home  and they tell you things  it's a disgrace  what they're teaching them  it's a disgrace  we're ending it  in fact  we're taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things  bad things  actually  we will teach our children the truth about america  that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth  and we are getting better every single day  and no party can lead america  that will not teach our children to love america  no party can do that  the sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down america and our way of life  we have a great way of life  and getting better all the time  look at what we've done  biden's running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail  including one who attempted murder  that's right  one who attempted to murder a police officer  and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl  13 members of biden's staff donated to the same fund  look  that's where they're coming from  just so you know  he's trying to go a little bit more right  like the fracking  ""oh  well of course  we're going to have 窶ｦ"" for six months  he's saying  there'll be no fracking  which i don't think the people in pennsylvania thrilled with  do you agree  considering that your taxes could quadruple  i tell it all the time  texas  right  texas  they like oil  they like guns  right  in texas  right  and they like god  so he comes out with a platform  no oil  we don't want oil  this is during the democrat deal  there'll be no oil  there'll be no god  there'll be no guns  this is not a good campaign  and then the fake news says  ""donald trump is tied in texas "" i'm tied  last time i was tied in texas until the day of the vote  then they announced  the second they called it  ""the polls in texas have closed  donald trump has won the state of texas "" think of it  he's against oil  he's against guns  they're going to confiscate your guns  second amendment's going to be destroyed  i am holding up your second amendment  if it's not me  look what i've done  you think it's been easy  they want to get rid of the second amendment  they're going to get rid of the guns  right  and religion  so  look what they're doing to religion  these states  everything's closed  except  you're allowed to protest  that's why i say everything we do is a protest  look at all those people back there  look at that  look it  they just form  wow  turn the cameras around  please  they never do it  turn the cameras around  please  wow  thank you  that's a lot of people  we're proud of you  that's a lot of people  you ever notice  they never do it  though  i say  ""turn the camera "" right from the beginning  they never did  they don't want to give us the credit for these big crowds  because you know what  when you see crowds like this  or in wisconsin  that i had a few nights ago  or last night was so incredible  what we had last night was just incredible  in minnesota  we're going to win it  1972  we're going to win it  1972  it hasn't 窶ｦ that's a long time ago  remember  i think reagan won every state except for minnesota  we're going to win minnesota  what we've done for them  we've opened up their livelihood again  maine  how about maine  i opened up 5 000 square miles of ocean  obama closed it  they said  ""why  he had no idea "" right off their shore  no fishing  no nothing  they called it a monument  right  right off their shore  maine  i mean  if i don't win maine 窶ｦ maine traditionally is not really very republican  but i won maine too last time  actually  because i love maine  too  i love maine  too  but think of what i did  i opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women  now they go lobster fishing and fishing  but 5  000  i said  ""why did they close it "" nobody was able to tell me  but i opened it up  an executive order  i totally opened it up  i did many other things  then i got the tariffs  they couldn't do business in european union  they couldn't do business in china  because they were charging tariffs to maine  so canada would take our fish and lobster  we'd sell it to canada for nothing  and they'd sell it to china and europe  because they didn't have to pay tariffs  not only did i get the 5 000 窶ｦ think of what  5 000 square miles  so you take one mile  square mile  multiply times 5 000  that's a big area  even in an ocean  right  it's massive  and it was the best area  the best  i got rid of the tariffs  i told them  ""if you tariff our maine lobster people  and fishermen and women  if you want a tariff on them  that's okay  but we're going to tariff your cars  okay "" which is a much bigger deal  it was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off  i did that off of maine  i did that in two weeks  okay  took me two weeks  once i found out about it  it's hard to believe it ever happened  so i did that for maine  and somebody said  i'm down in maine  how the hell can i be down in maine  after what i did  i'll tell you what if i do that from maine  and if maine doesn't vote for trump  i don't think i'm going back  okay  i can tell you one thing  their senator never did it for them  joe biden and the democrats want to gut police departments nationwide  you know that  right  here in north carolina  nearly 50 democrat state house members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding  endangering your families  i was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state  and we're joined by many of them tonight  where are they  thank you  sheriff  thank you  thank you  thank you  folks  thank you  thank you  you got to take care of our law enforcement  we got to take care  nobody can do the job like them  we have to let them do their job  we've got to stop this nonsense  this child's play  we've got to stop  they're great  you know  i was endorsed by  think of this  new york's finest  it's very tough  you know  de blasio's your mayor  he doesn't have a clue what's happening  either  i think sleepy joe's worse  do you want to know the truth  because this other guy has just an ideology that's just terrible  but de blasio is there  and new york's finest  first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate  they endorsed me  three weeks ago  that takes courage  think of it  chicago  the police in chicago  they could do their job  we don't even have to bring in the national guard  whenever we do  it takes about 30 minutes  it's over  right  like we did in minneapolis  30 minutes  remember that beautiful scene  they lined up  they went down  there was no social distancing in between these great  tough guys  there was no social distancing  tom tillis  they went down and they had  250 000 outfits  they had more crap on that helmet with night goggles  and these guys were sort of wise guys  right  they were shouting at them  screaming at them  they were screaming at the wrong people  they went down  they never had to stop  it was just forward  it all ended  it all ended in minneapolis  it took  you also had  what  a half an hour  remember  they hit the cnn reporter in the knee  he went down  ali velshi  he said  ""this is a friendly protest  it's wonderful to see such a 窶ｦ"" behind him  it was all fire for a block  it looked like berlin during the war  ""this is a friendly 窶ｦ"" what are they doing  how does that help to be like that  how does that help  we're joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me  one man who  especially over the last year  he has been so great  he couldn't be better  and i think he's doing very well  i'm looking at some numbers  and you're doing very well  and i think your opponent has some very big problems  senator tom tillis  thank you  tom  thank you  he's been great  smart guy  and he's got a couple of bills that he's putting in  one in particular  i love it  you got to do it  that if a sanctuary city causes problems  you can sue the sanctuary city  you can sue  will you get  we got to get that one moving  right  that's moving along  right  that's a great one  a man who  i just did a phone call for the other night  and the people love him  he's in a rough district  but he's now leading  i see you're up in the polls  congressman richard hudson  great guy  where's richard  great guy  he's a warrior  and two people i really liked  because we fought like hell for them a year ago  right  and they had guts  and they had what it takes  they didn't choke  you know  a lot of people choke  they choke  they gag  they can't breathe  greg murphy and dan bishop  they didn't choke  they're fantastic  they are fantastic people  thank you  look  they're friends  we're friends  those two guys were incredible  thank you very much  great job  really great job  and a man that should be your governor  i don't know  he's doing well  but lieutenant governor  dan forest  everybody  thank you very much  great job  handsome guy  handsome  looks like cary grant  i hear you're doing really well  look  i mean  this guy's got this state totally closed down  it's ridiculous  it's  when are they going to open  when are they going to open  dan  this would have been opened up a long time ago  and you would have done even better  i mean  you would have done better  and north carolina republican party chair  michael whatley  michael  thank you  michael  great job  michael  how are we doing  michael  how's it going  are we up  i mean  if i lose north carolina  i'm getting out of here  this is not 窶ｦ look at that  this is not  just so you know  the crowd of a man that's coming in second  i say it all the time  i said it when i left michigan  2016  the night of the election  we had 32 000 people  hillary was there  just before me  in a prime location  she had about 400 people  i got there at 12 in the evening  i started speaking at one in the morning  it's now election day  and i left  32 000 people  we had 32 000 people  so it's now election day  i start speaking  i started speaking  think of it  one o'clock in the morning  we had 30  you never saw anything like it  i left  i said  ""that doesn't look like we're going to lose michigan "" and guess what  we didn't  we won michigan  first time in decades  and you know what we've done  many  many car plants are now opening up  a great gentleman  who's just retiring  prime minister abe  of japan  i said  ""shinzo  please do me a favor  we need more car companies  you're selling cars into our country  please  we want to build here  not in japan  please "" he said  ""but we cannot do that  this is a free enterprise system "" i said  ""i know  shinzo  please  i need some car companies  please do it "" ""i can't do it "" i said  ""shinzo  you have to do it "" next day  it was a story  ""five car companies to open up in michigan "" right  so much for free enterprise  but he's a great guy  he's a friend of mine  he's great  they're lucky he's a friend of mine  i would have been much tougher  it's hard  when a guy is a friend  it's hard  but they did a lot  they did a lot  they helped it a lot  and what they've done here  by the way  japan  and what they've done in michigan  ohio  what they've done  by the way  we all love south carolina  right  right  i think we love it  now  south carolina  we're winning here  but south carolina  i hate to say this to you  i don't want to make you upset  we're winning by about 400 points  i spoke to a great person in south carolina who said  ""sir  you don't have to come here  this thing's up by a lot "" what the hell is the difference  right  i mean  we are up  and we're up good  but i'd love you to tie south carolina  what do we have to do  but a lot of activity in south carolina also  they're doing great  you had the best year you've ever had  they've had the best year they ever had  and you're going to go to a better year  we are going to have a better year  we're also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse  amy williams  who was reunited with her husband  sergeant first class townsend williams  at my state of the union address  everybody remembers that  everybody remembers was there  good  you're looking well  thank you very much  say hello to the whole family  thank you  thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors  and they are warriors  we're pursuing peace in afghanistan  it's very close  we're down to  we will soon be down to 4 000 soldiers  we're taking them out  they're serving as policemen  they're serving as police  and they've done a great job  we could win everything  but i'm not looking to kill three million people to win  what  to win what  we should have never been in the middle east  and we're bringing them back  we're bringing them back  just so you know  we're bringing them back from iraq  we're down to 2 000 soldiers in iraq  and in syria  we're all back  we're all finished  except for one thing  if it's okay with you  i decided to keep the oil  we took the oil  we kept it  and we'll always support america's incredible military families  so thank you very much  thank you  darling  really good  okay  in everything we do  we're putting america first  unlike other administrations  and not just obama and biden  this has gone on for many years  we put america first  and that's what we're doing  and you know what  other countries  for the first time in decades  respect us again  remember that  they respect us again  you know all about data  28 countries  we had six countries that were current  and the amount of current is too low  okay  six countries  i went in  and i said  ""you got to pay  sorry  you're delinquent "" they said  ""really "" ""yeah "" i said  ""you're delinquent  you got to pay "" obama would go  and make a speech and leave  that would be it  we were paying for it  we're protecting europe  and they're screwing us on trade  so we protect them  and they're screwing us on trade  no good  no good  can't do it  i said  ""it's unfair "" and the secretary general  stoltenberg  of nato  said  ""i've never seen "" and the fake news can call him up and check  he said  ""he's the greatest that we've ever seen "" for 20 years  the spending at nato went like this  right  and america  we pick it up  every time it goes down  they didn't pay  and i said  ""we're supposed to protect you  you're going to be attacked by russia or somebody  we're supposed to protect you  and yet you're delinquent  you don't pay your bills "" and that includes germany  they're paying 1%  they're supposed to pay two  and 2% is way too low  2% military spending  so we got  listen to this  it never gets reported by these fakers  we got  130 million more  more  not total  more  going to  over three years   400 billion  so we're going from 130 billion  with a b  not million  to  400 billion  and they said to me  they said 窶ｦ and they said to me  they said to me  very nice guy  head of one of the countries  at a table  i can't believe it never got released  but now we can talk about it  because it's three years ago  but they said  ""sir 窶ｦ "" and this was a big private meeting of all of the nations  ""does that mean if we don't 窶ｦ "" because i said  ""you got to pay your bills  we're protecting you  you're not paying your bills "" some did  like poland and some others  but most didn't  six to eight were current  and we were paying much more than we should have been paying  much more  i mean  it's europe  we got to defend ourself  and there was no guarantee that they'd help us if we ever had a problem  right  we're never going to have a problem  we got so much stuff now  we were depleted  now we have great 窶ｦ but they said to me  ""does this mean 窶ｦ "" and i had to give this answer  i can't believe it didn't get leaked by some sleazebag  we have leakers all over this place  but a lot of it didn't leak  a lot of it is just made up by the newspapers  they make up phony stories  they say  ""donald trump woke up today  he was in a very bad mood  according to sources "" there is no source  they just made it up  hey  i woke up  and i was in a bad mood  true  i've actually had a 窶ｦ i've been in a good mood  because we're doing so much for our country  we've done so much for our country  but at the nato meeting  one of the presidents of one of the good countries  all good  they said  ""sir  does this mean that if we don't pay  does this mean that you're going to leave  and you're not going to protect us "" i said  ""yes  that's what it means  i'm sorry "" it was an amazing effect  because other presidents said  ""no  we will always protect you  we will always protect you  even if you don't pay  even if our taxpayer is paying for everything  even though you take advantage of us on trade  you don't let our cars in  you don't let our stuff in  but you sell us like crazy  even though you tariff our product  even though you do everything  and then you take advantage of us with the military "" they said  ""we will always protect you "" so they didn't pay  why the hell would they pay  they said  ""boy  these guys are stupid "" so they asked me the question  ""does this mean  sir  that you will not protect us anymore if we don't pay "" i said  ""i'm sorry to say  it does "" that's a big story  three years ago  it's a big story  it was amazing how the money came in  so we took in 130 billion a year  going over a three-year period  to 400  just because i asked  right  just because i asked  true  they don't report that story  then we got lightweights that i fired  and they write books about me  that i'm a bad guy  ""oh  he's a terrible guy  he treats our allies so badly "" no  our allies treat us badly  our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies  i must be honest with you  they take advantage of us  everyone takes advantage of your country  and we don't put up with it  and you know what the funny thing  we get along better now  because they respect us again  before  they thought we were stupid  they respect us again  they do  i mean  look at israel  look what we did  i saw kerry this other day  is this guy the worst negotiator  gave iran 150 billion  plus 1 8 billion in cash  he never walked  sometimes in a negotiation  when you've given everything  and you can't give anymore  and then they want more  you get up ane walk  remember the bicycle accident  that was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race  73 years old  ""i promise "" i said  ""i will never ever 窶ｦ i promise to you  ride a bicycle in a race  or any other time frankly "" i will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation  and he broke his leg  and his arm  and he was all screwed up  and that was actually a good thing  because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal  which i terminated  nah  we had some terrible negotiators  and they all said  i saw them the other day  this was him like a year ago  ""mark my words  you will never ever sign deals with arab countries  with israel  it can't be done "" well  we just signed the two great ones  and we got about seven more that want to come in  what a bunch  what a bunch  and then they say bad things about your president  they don't like my foreign policy  i like my foreign policy  you like it  no  we were taken advantage of by the whole world  they're so stupid  so stupid  we've spent the last four years reversing the damage that biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period  joe biden is weak  he's supported every globalist sellout of north carolina  the workers  what he's done  and when i say  ""him""  it's him and people in his little group that 窶ｦ you've achieved so much over a period of time  he sold it out  look at nafta  how bad was nafta  china's entry into the world trade organization  tpp would have destroyed our car industry  and of course  he joined and wanted to join the paris climate accord  that's another beauty  that would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars  that was actually  i think  designed to put us out of business  literally  biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to china and other countries  this state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the nafta and china disasters  you know that  you lost 43%  but i think the real number is 61%  by the way  biden says that this an election between scranton and park avenue  by the way  he left scranton  he likes to say  ""i was born in pennsylvania "" but he doesn't say he left  his father left  not his fault  but they make it like he's 窶ｦ no  he went to delaware  he doesn't leave delaware  that i can tell you  every time i see this guy 窶ｦ wilmington  delaware  does he ever leave  i'm in los angeles  i'm trying to work on the fires  they ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe  ridiculous  the floors of the forest  it's got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone  matchsticks  forest management  naturally  this is an election  not between scranton or wherever it is  it's really between scranton and china  you know that  scranton and china  i'm with america  biden is with china  if biden wins  china wins  if we win  america wins  north carolina wins  pennsylvania wins  and the american workers win in every single state  to save our auto industry  i withdrew from this horrible  horrible deal  trans-pacific partnership  earlier this year  i kept my promise to north carolina when i ended the nafta nightmare  you got hit so hard  all those empty buildings all over the place  but a lot of them now are filled up because of us  they filled up  when did they fill up  over the last three-and-a-half years  i proudly signed a brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law  which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the united states  and it's already doing  we invested  2 5 trillion in the us military  defense spending in north carolina has soared by more than  1 billion a year  congratulations  good job  we launched the first new branch of the us armed forces  this by itself would be a big achievement  this is one of so many different things  right to try  the military  the vets  everything  we've done so much  but we 窶ｦ 75 years  right  last one was the air force  the army  the navy  the air force  the marines  the coast guard  they're so good  we have another one now  for 75 years  space force  we need it  i never even promised that  right  one of them said recently that  ""he's actually done more than he promised in the campaign "" that means i'm probably the only politician in history  they will tell you  these incredible women up here from north carolina  stand up  will you  please  these are most incredible people  thank you  stand up  turn around for the cameras  so they can see how incredible you are  thank you  man  oh  man  what a life  but we took care of the va with veterans choice  you saw that  what obama was nothing  it wasn't working  the mission act  that's amazing  and accountability  where we can fire people in the va that aren't taking great care of our vets  okay  ""you're fired  get out  you're fired  out "" we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdad  we took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many others  qasem soleimani  he's dead  he's dead  i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  i kept my promise  recognized the true capitol of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and we got it built  i was signing a sheet of paper  you've heard this story   1 1 billion  i said  ""what's this for "" they said  ""sir  now that you've moved  we're going to build an embassy in israel  in jerusalem "" i say  ""how much is it "" ""1 1 billion "" you got some friends of mine here  they're builders  you don't spend 1 1 billion on a one-story building  i don't know what's going on  so i said  ""so  does it have to cost so much "" ""yes  sir  we're buying land"" so i called david friedman  he's our ambassador  he's one of the most successful lawyers in new york  he's a brilliant guy  he loves israel  right  love israel  i call him  he's the ambassador  he's there  i said  ""david  they want to spend 1 1 billion on a damn one-story embassy  it's crazy "" i said  ""would you take a look  maybe we own some land "" we own a lot of land  we've been there a long time  calls me back  he said  ""let me take a look at it  sir "" he calls me the next day  ""sir  we have a great piece of land  a much better location that we were going to way overpay for  a much bigger piece  we have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great "" i said  ""that's fantastic  david  how much will it cost to renovate the building "" ""i think we can do it for  190 000 "" so i said  ""david "" it's the first time i've ever done it  i said  ""david  it's too cheap  you got to spend more than that "" so a friend of mine  ron baron  he's got an office building  and he's got jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building  jerusalem stone  and every time i go in  he goes  ""oh  you got to see jerusalem stone "" and he paid a fortune for it  he's so proud of it  he doesn't talk about anything but his jerusalem stone  i said  ""david  do me a favor  you're i jerusalem  right "" ""yes "" ""do they have jerusalem stone "" ""they got so much  we don't know what to do with it "" i said  ""use all jerusalem stone when you're rebuilding the building  when you do your renovation  everything  wrap it in jerusalem stone "" so i think we ended up spending  to fix up the building  like  500 000  can you believe it  we were going to spend 1 1 billion  and by the way  it would never get built  it wouldn't be built in 20 years from now  and they like it so much  they gave up the plan  they think this is better  it's a better location  it's probably a better building  but i could tell you stories like that all night long  the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost  and then they use the electric catapults  you've heard that  right  they don't want to use steam  why  because it's too simple  because it works  because it's better  so they go to electric catapults that they're working on for years now  elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic  magnets  it sounds good  trust me  it doesn't work  one little glass of water  we're in the ocean  one little glass of water  boom  those magnets are gone  i could have told them that  i actually asked the architect  "" have you ever built a ship before "" it's unbelievable  you heard the story last night about air force one  it saved a lot of money  i said to boeing  ""no  it's got to have a three in front of it "" they were going to buy air force one  5 7 billion  it's a lot of money  but look  it's a helluva a deal  it's a helluva a plane  what can i tell you  i said  ""how much is the new plane "" it was signed by obama  ""5 7 billion  sir "" i said  ""that's a lot of money "" it's actually two planes  air force one is two planes  i'll give you a little  they're going to say  ""that's classified information "" well  they've been flying around with two planes for 30 years  so i assume somebody knows  and our air force one is 31 years old  right  so  look  it's time  a lot of the arab sheiks come in  i see their plane  they have a brand new one  i say  ""what do we have "" 31 years  and we're protecting them  why the hell don't we have a new one  so they finally had  at 31 years old  the new one is totally different  747  it's much longer  bigger wingspan  much more beautiful  it's modern  it's beautiful  5 7 billion  so i said to the head of boeing  nice guy  dennis  this was before they had their difficulty  which is terrible what happened to them  but i said to him  ""dennis  i'm not going to spend  5 7 billion on a plane  i'm not going to do it  i won't do it  it's too much "" i said last night  i told this story  first time  i said  ""it's got to have a three on it "" he said  ""we can't do it  no "" he called me up the following day  ""we'll take 200 million off "" somebody said  ""well  what are you losing "" i said  ""nothing  in fact  we're gaining a generator "" and i said  ""you got to build an extra generator "" he said  ""we'll take 200 million off "" i said  ""nope "" i said to the general in charge  i said  ""general  can we break the deal "" ""yes  sir  we can  we have a cancellation clause "" ""good  general  execute your cancellation clause  we're not going to buy it  i'm not going to pay  5 7 billion for air force one  i'm

9,9,Sep,2019,datasets/Fayetteville,"thank you everybody  thank you and vice president mike pence  thank you very much  incredible  and  hello to fayetteville  hello  fayetteville  it's great to be here in north carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith  family  god and country  thank you  thank you  tomorrow you'll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts america first  dan bishop  i've just come from a meeting with north carolina officials representing communities hit by hurricane dorian and i expressed the unwavering solidarity of the american people  we are behind you 100%  100%  the prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of north carolina  south carolina  georgia  florida and everyone else that was in the storms path  and i will say i was called by the government of the bahamas and we're helping with the bahamas  they were hit so hard  they were hit so hard  who would believe it  we pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process  and i will say  north carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest  that was a little bit of a surprise  but i know one thing about north carolina  you can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully  and  you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever  right  no doubt about it  i also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from dorian  in particular  franklin graham  he's a wonderful guy  he's got an organization  samaritan's purse  based right here in north carolina and the work that franklin and his family and all of those that are with franklin graham we want to thank them  special  great people  great people  thank you franklin  thank you  incredible job  he does such a great job  all over  whenever there's a problem you see samaritan's purse and franklin and his people  we love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side  north carolina will truly recover so fast  i know you people so well  let's not even talk about it  let's not even talk about it  we're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong  in just over two years  we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly  nobody thought this would happen  you know we won the greatest election  certainly one of them  but maybe the greatest  but we won窶ｦ let's say one of the greatest  this way i won't be criticized  they'll say  ""you know  george washington had a great election too "" the fake news right  the fake news  but  we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that  and you would be in big trouble if we didn't  i can tell you that  you'd be窶ｦ instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction  we have the number one economy anywhere in the world  and every time i meet a foreign leader  almost every time  they say  ""congratulations on what you've done with the economy "" i said  ""i didn't do it  i just set a certain path  the people of the united states did it "" number one anywhere in the world  and they tried to do the recession thing  you know  they tried the russia thing  that didn't work  they tried many other things  i always say  ""the media and their partner  the democrats "" i wouldn't mind fighting the democrats  but we really have to look at it as a two-some  it's the media and the democrats  it's one and the same  we're rebuilding our military  defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation  america is winning again and america is respected again  they respect america  by the way  i have about 10 women in the front row and you come from north carolina and they travel all over the place  hold up your hands  these are great women  i see them so much  and i must say they have other things to do  they look rich as hell to me  i don't know  how many is this  how many rallies have you come too  they can't count  they said all of them except for two  that's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area  that's so great  well  at least you won't have to travel so far for this one  right  thank you very much for being here  we really appreciate it  well  we appreciate it  we appreciate it  thank you  really incredible people  but you know  we've created six million new jobs since election day and i couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it  six million new jobs  more americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country  almost 160 million americans  nobody would have thought that was possible  we wouldn't have been able to say it actually  we've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3%  so the people that work so hard窶ｦ you remember i used to say during the rallies before we won  people worked two jobs  three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up  the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better  so importantly  more than 70 million americans have been lifted off of food stamps  nearly 600 000 americans entered the labor force last month alone  think of that  and the unemployment rate for african-americans just reached another brand new  yesterday  all time low in the history of our country  how do you lose that debate  remember i used to say  ""why do you have to lose "" well  now you have the best unemployment numbers  employment and unemployment numbers  that you've ever had as african-americans  as asian-americans  as hispanic-americans  the best numbers we've ever had  and by the way  african-american youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history  and  the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years  and soon will be 35 years  and soon  i promise  will probably end up being better than ever  i can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years  so  i always say kiddingly  ""i'm sorry i didn't make it historic "" but you know what  it's going to be historic very soon  it'll be historic very soon  and  here in north carolina  over 230 000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%  amazing  but  the radical democrats want to dismantle  demolish  and destroy everything that you've gained  and they will do it  and it won't take that long  and  that's why we need dan bishop and greg murphy  we need them  we need them going down  we need them going down to congress and helping  but  they can do it  it's also why we need four more years  it has to窶ｦ see  it's like a plant  we've changed things  right  keep america great  we've changed things  but it's gotta grow  it's gotta develop those roots  and  once it does  it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done  very hard  and  that's really why i consider this election窶ｦ look  we had a very  very special day in 2016  it was a very special day  very special day  it was an incredible day  an incredible month  an incredible year  and i don't know that you can ever compare anything to it  but  i can say this  2020 is essentially just as important  because they'll try and take it away  whether it has to do with religion  our evangelicals are here tonight  and they're all over the place  and  what we've done for them  and for religion  is so important  you know  the other side  i don't think they're big believers窶ｦ they're not big believers in religion  that i can tell you  you listen to some of them  they're trying  and they're trying put out little statements  they're not working too well  little statements that are a little bit  sort of  not too good  huh  what is the word we want to use  yeah  a little窶ｦ nah  nah  they're pushing a little hard  and it's not working  to stop the far left  you must vote in tomorrow's special election  so important  or  get your votes in early  i think a lot of窶ｦ who voted early for dan bishop  good  well  that's good  but the big thing is tomorrow  tomorrow is the election  and you'll get out  to protect your family  you must defeat open borders  and  you have democrat named dan mccready  and he wants open borders  he wants sanctuary cities  he's not going to protect your second amendment  he's doing nothing on your sec窶ｦ you know  north carolina's a very big second amendment state  and  dan bishop  greg murphy  these guys  they're going to protect your second amendment  but  one of the biggest issues in this election is  in fact  sanctuary cities  mccready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods  get out  go ahead  go into the neighborhood  go into窶ｦ what's your neighborhood  where do you窶ｦ what  rutherford county  okay  so  how do you feel about having them released  hardened  horrible criminals into rutherford county  i don't think so  but  your whole state窶ｦ honestly窶ｦ can i be honest  it's crazy what's happening  this whole thing with sanctuary cities  and you go to california  which is so many sanctuary cities  they don't know what's happening out there  you have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities  they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected  a lot of illegal voting going on out there  by the way  a lot of illegal voting  in august  mccready said it was ""the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state窶ｦ"" i'm using the words great state  he doesn't  ""窶ｦ of north carolina "" with the support and encouragement of mccready  sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities  and you see it  you see it  the charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault  robbery  drug crimes  kidnapping  and homicide  murder  why would you do it  why would you do it  what is it  explain it  just recently  mecklenburg county set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child  support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to american citizens  and mccready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals  tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the america-hating left  and it's gotta be  and  by the way  we're building that wall  and it's going up very big  very big  and  you think it's easy to get money when you have the entire democrat party窶ｦ and  they control the house  and we want to change that  we want to flip the house  we'll get so much  it'll be amazing what we can do for our country  we don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in north carolina  we want to take care of it  this state should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans  not for criminal aliens  our great republican candidate  dan bishop  will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state  dan  come on up  dan bishop  everyone  get out and vote  come on up  dan  we need a doctor  a doctor in the house  please  a doctor  please  doctor in the house  thank you  take your time  please  take your time  we've got plenty of time  thank you  take your time  thank you  doctor  take your time  people have been standing outside for two days to get in  so this happens  thank you  thank you  doctor  doing better  good  that's good  that's good  that's great  that's really great  thank you  thank you  sir  thank you  that's really great  thank you very much  i guess dan's speech wasn't so good  what do you think  that's great  thank you very much  great job  thank you  doctor  thank you  everybody  thank you  law enforcement  thank you very much  thank you  thank you  dan  that was a good job  that was a good job  he means it  too  he's great  go out and vote tomorrow for dan bishop  please  so  we've had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now  and we need him to keep going  because he has been fantastic  and  i believe he's here tonight  i just came in  the weather wasn't so great to be traveling today  and they said  ""maybe we could skip north carolina today  sir "" so  i said  ""no  thank you "" i said  ""no  thank you "" can you imagine  and  by the way  i have to say  we have a big crowd in here  right  you haven't seen outside  thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in  and  when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows  i just want to tell you we really thank you  incredible  but  thom tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time  he's recently introduced a bill to give american victims the right to sue sanctuary cities  that's a big deal  and hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered  but  to pass the bill  we need more republicans  tomorrow there is another crucial special election  and we have a fantastic guy running in that one  too  republican greg murphy  it looks like he's in good shape  but you've got to get it out  so  i want to introduce thom tillis  and i want to introduce greg murphy  i want to thank you both  thank you  thank you  thom  and thank you  greg  so  greg murphy is looking to  like dan  cut your taxes  defend your second amendment  support our policies  really  really support our military and our veterans  we have rebuilt our military  greg murphy  come on up for a second here  greg murphy  come up  come up  greg  come on up  greg  come on up  greg  just for a second  then  we'll get back to business  we've got to do this  and i don't know  he's been a great champ thank you  greg  come  please  good luck tomorrow  greg  get out there and vote for those two guys  they're terrific  we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific republican leaders  a man who's really been stepping up to the front  he defended justice kavanaugh when he was treated so badly  i've never seen anything like the treatment that justice kavanaugh received  and  everybody respects him  and everybody likes him  and  i like him  and we used to fight like hell  right  but  we don't fight anymore  we like each other a lot  and he's a special man  and  he's become a special friend  senator lindsay graham  another man who is a fighter窶ｦ i guess we're all fighters  you have to be a fighter or you're not going to be here very long  i can tell you that  we've got to fight them more than anybody else  but  a man who's done an incredible job in washington  took over a rough situation  and he's become a real leader  and that's republican leader  kevin mccarthy  kevin  kevin's working so hard for so many different people  he wants to see dan and greg win so badly  thank you for being here  appreciate it  leader  representative david rouzer  david  thank you  david rouzer  he's done a fantastic job  our lieutenant governor who is going to be  i think  a highly competitive candidate for a very important race  dan forest  thank you  dan  thank you very much  dan  we also have north carolina republican party chair  michael whatley  what a job you've done  and  we have a man from north carolina who loves this state  he fights so hard  he doesn't know what it is not to fight  you know who i'm talking about  they got it  mark  you're all screaming  ""mark meadows "" that's right  he's great  so many  jim jordan  andy biggs  gaetz  and窶ｦ i just got so窶ｦ by the way  devin nunez  devin nunez  how about devin  he was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that comey was a stone cold liar and leaker  but  he knew it all the time  devin nunez  but  mark meadows is pretty incredible  and do they love窶ｦ 窶ｦ but mark meadows has been incredible  and do they love him in your state  do they love mark meadows  thank you mark  also a friend of mine who's been with us from the beginning  he's not a politician but he might as well be one  he loves us  he loves this party and he loves your state  lives here  louis dejoy  one of the most successful people  thank you  louis and your wife is窶ｦ doing a great job louis  and a very special thanks to my son  don junior and kimberly  great job  did don junior give a good speech  i heard that  they all said  ""he was on fire "" well  he's fighting  he loves this country  my son loves this country  my family loves this country  and two people  from your state  that the first lady  before she was first lady  she said  ""you know  there are two people that are unbelievable  you've got to watch them "" i said  ""i'm not interested  i'm too busy "" ""no  no  no  you have to watch them  they're so great  they're so smart  they love the country  they love you "" diamond and silk  they are incredible  incredible people  thank you very much  thank you  what a job  and they're doing very well i have to tell you that  our shared republican agenda is pro-worker  pro-jobs  pro-family  pro-growth  and 100% pro-american  and by the way  so is doug collins  and so john ratcliffe  thank you fellows  thank you  two incredible fighters also  for decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest  you know that better than anybody  and this state knows it better than anybody  they traded away your factories  sold your future  squandered your tax dollars  sacrificed your security  and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another  but all of that is changed  we're respected again  they're all saying  ""oh  gee  i hope he doesn't do this or that "" they've taken advantage of us for years  and i have to say sadly  in many cases it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country  but now you finally have a president who understands that i'm not supposed to be the president of the world  i'm supposed to be the president of the united states of america  to bring back our jobs for other countries  we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history  we've cut a record number of job killing regulations  no president  no longer how long they serve  has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations  and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good  and we have tremendous potential upward  and china wants to talk  they want to talk  china's lost three million jobs  thousands of companies are leaving china  the supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs  and our country has taken over things that you would've never thought  as an example  hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs  and china is eating the cost  which the fake news doesn't want to tell you  and out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in  because of the fact that our great american patriot farmers have been targeted by china  they've been targeted  because they know the farmer is like trump  i love the farmers  so they targeted the farmers  and i said to sonny perdue  secretary of agriculture  ""sonny  how much was it  last year and the year before  tell me "" it was  12 billion and it was  16 billion  and out of the tariffs that we've taken in  we gave to our farmers for distribution  hopefully very good distribution  hopefully very even distribution  we've given them  28 billion so that they're whole  so that they're whole  nobody would ever do that  nobody would ever do that  i can tell you that right now  and our farmers know we have to fight  i see it all the time  where some of the networks that are crazy  they have a group of farmers  in some cases they have groups of women  they say  ""what do you think of president trump "" ""we like him a lot  we're with him all the way "" and they want to turn off the cameras  they go crazy  but with the farmers you know that  you ever see that  the 10 women  ""what do you think of president trump "" ""we love him "" boy would i like to put you on television  i'll tell you right now  and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough  but they say to the farmers  ""you voted for president trump  are you happy "" and ever one of them said  ""he did things that no ones ever done before "" who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million   28 billion  because they've been targeted  that's the amount i asked sonny  i said sonny  ""what's the amount they've took our of our farmers "" ""it was 16 billion and the year before 12 "" and said sonny  ""we got to make that up "" and we made that up  who would do that  nobody would do that  first of all  nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from china because it's always been the other way around  china has taken advantage of our country for decades  decades  and i guarantee you one thing  none of these democrats  whether it's pocahontas or sleepy joe  none of them would be able to do a thing about it  and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by china  china made  500 billion over the last number of years  on a yearly basis  they steal our intellectual property  so many other things  so now it's just different  and now it's working the other way  and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them  they're a beautiful thing  and i want china to do well  and i hope they do well  but they've had now the worst year in 57 years  i wonder why  i wonder why  and hopefully it'll all work out  we'll see  we're going to be talking next week  we're talking now  they're going to be coming to the united states in two or three weeks  and we'll see what happens  but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country  let's face it  we can not go back to a situation  we're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to china becomes standard fare  not going to happen  we can't do it  and we have many other countries also  but we'll worry about them a little bit later  plenty of others  they've taken advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe  and i've been saying this for many years  i was saying this when i was a private citizen  they take our jobs  they make our product  they sell the product into our country with no tax  no nothing  so we end up with closed factories  no jobs  no taxes  no nothing  and these other countries gain  as an example  mexico  i must say they've really helped us at the border  the democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes  which would be so good  so we're doing it a different way  and mexico is now patrolling with 27 000 troops  they've never had two troops steward our border  and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57%  but our country could fix it so easy if the democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes  but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders  they want to have drugs pouring into our country  you have to have a wall and you have to stop it  and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking  and it's mostly women  they traffic in women and they pour through our borders  well  every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles  and we intend by next year  at the end of the year  to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built  and this is serious wall  this is the real deal  serious wall  and i want to thank our new secretary of defense  mark esper  for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat  and you have to  what can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders  and we have the worst walls  we have the weakest walls in the history of any country  you can't do anything to stop them  you have program  catch and release  you catch them and then you have to release them  and they're suppose to come back to court in the next three  four  fix  six years  and nobody shows up  and democrats don't want to fix it  so we're stopping them  so we don't even have to worry about court  we ended the last administrations cruel war on american energy  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  and for all of these crazy people  but they're not so crazy  they know what they're doing  that talk about russia  russia  russia  russia's not too happy about that  their primary source of income is oil and gas  and now we're bigger than russia  bigger than saudi arabia  we're bigger than everybody  and we're doing great  so they're not exactly happy  the russian hoax  was a pure hoax  you saw that with comey the other day  yet every leading democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy  and wage an under窶ｦ if you look at what's going on your way of life is under assault by these people  i mean  i go out and sometimes i'll get these huge audiences  and i wish we could've gotten a large arena than this  we tried  i was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet  but they said it was a little bit out of your district  and i said  ""i don't know if it looks good being out of your district "" but i was willing to do it  i would've taken it  i would have been very proud to have done it  it would've shown it's my real hair at least  it wouldn't be pretty  but it's my hair  may not be great  but i will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age  a lot better  a lot  but we had a different location  as you all know  and we said  ""let's do this one  it's bigger "" and we put screens outside for all of the people  we have screens and loud speakers and everything  it's really amazing what's going on out there  but after years of building up there countries  we are finally building up our country  that's the bottom line  the last administration  with biden and obama at the helm  they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated  the transpacific partnership  you could've kissed many of your industries goodbye  tpp would've gutted the american auto industry  it would've been even worse than nafta  and we know how bad nafta was  all you have to do  is even to this day  look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to mexico  not under the usmca  we got to get nancy pelosi to put it in for a vote  make it bipartisan  she'll have tremendous democrat support  the farmers want it  the unions want it  the manufacturers want it  and by the way  600 000 manufacturing jobs in this country  remember  you would need a magic wand  you can't do that anymore  well  we did it  but we've got to get usmca put up for a vote by the democrats  but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew from that job destroying tpp catastrophe  and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country  you can go back as far as you want  nafta  the disaster of nafta  so whatever you do  start talking to your people  we need a vote on the usmca  that's united states  mexico  and canada  and they've already voted  they want it and we want it  and it's great for the farmers  it's great for everybody  we're also aggressively combating a problem that you have in north carolina  problem that we have in almost all states  the opioid epidemic  last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years  at the center of the american drug crisis is the border crisis  criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border  including heroin  meth  cocaine  and fentanyl  100 000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border  and we can get the democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter  we got to get them  we got to get them  we got to get them  so if you want to stop the drug smugglers  the human traffickers  the viscous ms13 gang members  and by the way thank you to ice  these people go into those nests  we call them nets  these are vicious  vicious people  we got into the nests with our ice people  and for them it's another day at the office  there aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living  let me see  that guy would  maybe him  maybe her  right  maybe her  but it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do  so dangerous  these are many killers in those gangs  and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands  ms13  and as you know  democrats even want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants  as long as i'm your president i will never  ever let democrats take away your healthcare  and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally  we can't do that  it's a tremendous incentive to come in  democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas  all at the expense of supporting their own communities  republicans  no matter what you do  where you are  we want people to obey our laws  you want people that are going to help our country  the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream  every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare  force private doctors out of medicine  and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments  and they want to take away your private healthcare  your private insurance  180 million people will lose with what they want to do  it's a disaster  it's like  did you ever really feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely  you don't have any choice  you have to vote for me  i can leave right now  i can say  ""north carolina  i've had it with you  i'm leaving right now "" and you know what  you got to go out and vote  what are you going to do  put one of these crazy people running our country again  but it's never been so far left  i told a story the other day about a business man i saw  one of the biggest in the country  you probably know his name  he's hated me for 20 years  and i've hated him also  okay  now they're going to go out tomorrow  ""breaking news  donald trump hates people "" you're sort of right about that  i never liked this guy  and i see him in the white house  and i say  ""what are you doing here "" and he goes  ""mr  president "" see now he calls me mr  president  he used to call me something else  ""mr  president  i'm fighting for your victory "" i said  ""you got to be kidding "" he goes  ""honestly  you're doing a great job  but also if this radical left gets in they're going to take away everything  and they're going to destroy our country "" and for the first time i like this guy  my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you  remember president obama  28 times  remember 28 times  they counted them and there's much more than that i would imagine  that you can choose your plan  you can choose your doctor  it didn't work out that way  did it  obamacare  and we're keeping obamacare alive  we got rid of the individual mandate  the worst part of obamacare  we're keeping it and running it as well as it can  but the premiums are too high  the deductibles are through the roof  it's ridiculous  and we're coming up with lindsey graham and all of the folks  we're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house  that's why dan and greg  if we take back the house  if we keep the senate  and maybe even increase it a little bit  wouldn't be bad  and on the assumption we keep the presidency  you're going to have great healthcare  thank you  we almost had it  we had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out obamacare  and when he voted it didn't work out that way  did it  we had it  and we would have had it  but we're going to end up actually with a better plan  sometimes through adversity things work out better  we're going to end up with a better plan  you watch  we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also  always  yep  my word  our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up to the moment of birth  and if you look at the governor of virginia  he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution  he was talking after the baby is born  the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives  this is a radical democrat idea  that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  and socialism  they're socialists  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and the american dream  every day they're making good on the motto  ""promise made  promises kept "" in fact  we are keeping even more promises by far than we made  or than we promised  so many more  so many more  so many more  you know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill  right  right to try it's called  i love that name  right to try  we have some of the greatest doctors in the world  labs in the world  hospitals in the world  and we have incredible medicine that's prohibited from being used until it gets approval  and sometimes that approval can take many years  and i said  ""wait a minute  if a person is sick窶ｦ "" and they've been trying to get this for 45 years  i said  ""if a person is sick  and maybe terminally ill  why aren't we letting them try this new technology "" and so many things are happening  and we did right to try  and it wasn't easy  but i was helped by lindsey and a lot of great people  a lot of great people  all of them helped  mark helped so much  all of them help  rick  we have had a tremendous success  we had so many people wanting to help  but it was complicated believe it not because the country didn't want the liability  i said  ""you know what you do  you draw up an agreement taking away liability "" they said  ""that's a good idea "" the insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure  this has been going on for many years  i got it done  the results have been unbelievable  right to try  things that we've never even talked about we're getting done  maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month  we'll have close to 180 federal judges  including the public division judges  including two great new supreme court justices  justice neil gorsuch  and justice brett cavanaugh  who they put through hell  we passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century  we passed va choice  so when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks  four weeks  five days  10 days  two months  they go to a private doctor  we pay for the bill  and they get themselves taken care of  instead of dying  which was happening  and we also passed va accountability on behalf of our great veterans  that means when they treat our veterans  and they wouldn't have done it in primetime i can tell you  but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say  ""you're fired  get the heck out "" it's called va accountability  that's another one we've been trying  and in all fairness the unions made it very tough  civil service made it almost impossible  everyone said  ""you're never going to get it done "" we got it done  we want to thank the republican senate  i want to thank some incredible people in the house of representatives  and kevin i want to thank you窶ｦ 窶ｦ people in the house of representatives  and kevin  i want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one  that was a great job  thank you  kevin mccarthy  we've received record funding for the us military  700 billion last year  716 billion dollars this year  738 billion dollars 窶ｦ and you know  know i'm a big believer in budgets but we have no choice  we had to rebuild our military with all that's going on today with china  with russia  with radical islam  with everything that's happening  we had to do something  and you know  budgets are fine  i love budgets and we will get to that  don't worry about it  but we had to rebuild  our military was totally depleted  it was totally depleted  we have beautiful new f-35's  f-18's  new ships  new missiles  new rockets  we have new everything  i came back with admiral brown  the united states coast guard and some of the other folks  and they were saying that the new coast guard cutters 窶ｦ how good a job has the coast guard done during these hurricanes  and i said  ""admiral  how good are the new coast guard cutters "" he said  ""they're the finest in the world  sir "" and they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring  they have brand new coast guard cutters  we had to do it  we had to do it  there's always time for the other but we had to do it  we've rebuilt our military  we've taken care of the great people that work in our military  we gave them a raise  a beautiful raise they were so entitled to  and i also got other nato members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren't paying  they were delinquent  we're supposed to protect them and they don't pay  i say you can't do that  you can't do that  you got to pay  nato  now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense  we're negotiating with a lot of them  think of it  we have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them  how did that happen  and do you know what the biggest excuse is when i go to them and i'll say  ""king  you got to pay "" or  ""mr  prime minister  you got to pay "" or  ""mr  president  you've got to pay "" you know  it's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy  you know what their biggest thing is  because i can't understand how we did this for so many years  decades  decades 窶ｦ ""you have been defending all of 窶ｦ"" i won't mention names because i don't want to embarrass anybody  i don't want to  forget it  some of the wealthiest countries in the world  and when i say  ""king  president  prime minister  queen "" no matter what i say  you know what they say  ""but nobody's ever asked us to do that before "" that's the only excuse  because i say to them  ""why would we do this  why are we defending you  you're immensely wealthy  you compete with us on trade "" we have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them  ""why are we protecting you  mr  president "" ""well  i don't know  i don't know "" but you know what their answer is  ""because you've always done it "" that's not a great answer  so we're taking in billions and billions but i've got 100 billion dollars and the secretary general of nato  stoltenberg  is my biggest fan  he said  ""until president trump  you had to see the data across the spending was going like this "" and ours was going like this  we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly  we were defending them and now it's changing  around 100 billion dollars  they're not happy  and then i read where obama is more popular in germany than trump  he's got to be  i'm making people pay their bills  he's got to be  you know  the day that i'm more popular than him  i'm not doing my job  the big story  they like him more in europe than they like trump  i think they should  100 billion dollars more they're paying  to protect america's security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal  we paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work  i withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens  but i can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well  when i came into office  iran was a real terror  18 sites of confliction  they were behind every one of them in the middle east  and who knows  could have been elsewhere  and i said we're not going to do it  150 billion dollars president obama paid and 1 8 billion in cash  whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion  in hundred dollar bills  it's a lot  now take a million dollars and make it 1 8 billion dollars in cash  i'm actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars  you want to know the truth  1 8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so i terminated the deal  and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem which every president said they would do  and i also approved for israel the golan heights and if you really think about it  i said to people  ""what's more important  the golan heights or the capital of jerusalem by moving our embassy there "" he said  ""neither  sir  what you've done in iran is more important than both of them "" i said  ""you know  i guess you're right when you think about it "" so we've done a good job  all of us together  as a movement we've done a great job for israel  for years  you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of north carolina  you must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing  you  it's true  it's not about me  it's about you  it's about your family  your future and the fate of your country  that's what we did in 2016  they came from the hills and valleys  they came from the cities  they came from all over the place and people were saying  these fakers back there  they were saying  ""what the hell is happening "" but i knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies  the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever  ever  ever in politics  ever in politics  a vote for any democrat in 2020 and a vote for any democrat tomorrow in north carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the american dream  we are entering this campaign with the best record  the best results  the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of north carolina  and i've said it and i say it loudly and proudly  i don't believe there's been any president or any administration that has done more in 2 5 years then we have as a group in america  when you add it all up  nobody's done what we have  our first task is a giant victory  tomorrow  right here in the great state of north carolina with your support  tomorrow we take the first steps to firing speaker pelosi and winning back the house in 2020  we need everybody to get your friends  get your family  get your neighbors and get out and vote for dan bishop and get out and vote for greg murphy  you got to get out tomorrow and vote  together we will lift millions more from our horrible  horrible situations that have developed over the years  look at what's happening to democrat-run cities  every single one of them  we are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  with your help  we will elect for republicans to congress to create a safe  modern  fair and lawful system of immigration  we will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa  made in the usa  you want made in america  i don't care  what do you like better  made in america or made in the usa  go ahead  wait  ready  you want made in america then made in the usa  what do you like better  made in america  made in the usa  okay  i think we know that answer  so in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics  make america great again  now we are within moments hopefully of having  despite what you heard a few weeks ago  where we were heading  and they're going  ""please  please let there be a recession  please "" they're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election  they're not going to win the election  don't forget  we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of china and other countries on trade  what happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed  we're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that are unfair to our country  think what happens when it all gets fixed  we have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong  but we had a phrase  make what  make america great again  the best  i think it was maybe the greatest  2016  but we've done a lot and now they're very close to setting a new 窶ｦ i think it's the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market  right  many  many times  many  many times  i can't be certain that many but it's a lot  okay  i always have to preface it because there'll be headlines  trump didn't tell the truth  so i've always got to be extremely cautious  we had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree  make america great again  maga country  make america great again  now we still have a year and a half  little bit less  can you believe it  can you believe it  i stood in the white house with the first lady that first night and i said  ""wow  look at this  that's the bedroom of abraham lincoln "" you have to see this  it's so perfectly done  it's so the way it was  we announced it in front of the press and in 2026  and i said  ""well  wait a minute  under the normal rules i will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term "" oh  they're going crazy  tomorrow  you will see headlines  trump wants an extra term  i told you  i told you  he wants an extra term  ladies and gentlemen  we told you  we told you he's a dictator  we told you  no  no  i'm only kidding  i'm only kidding  but we actually have the world cup  it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it  and that's where we're working it also with mexico and canada to give them some of the games  we've got a great relationship with the world cup  it's a big deal  bob kraft helped me with the new england patriots people  tom brady had a pretty good game the other night  right  they have a good a coach  whether you like it or not  and i know you  north carolina  but how good a coach  in all fairness here  is coach belichick  how good is he  i know you want to be cool but he's pretty good  we have to appreciate genius  we all like genius  but we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science  medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the aids epidemic in america  that's shocking to hear that but we can do it  we're going to do it  definitely  incredible  the strides that we have made  we will defeat the democrats to drive up the cost of houses  cars  healthcare and education by liberating americans from their analysts' push for a job killing  soul crushing washington regulations  as an example  we're trying to get the car companies  going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today  and you'll save 3 500 dollars  think of that  it will be safer  it will be better  you can save 3 500 dollars  it will be less costly  and we're going to try to get that done  and then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune  so i signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs  i don't know about you  much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us  but you know  somebody told me that as you know  they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save  but they said that if the bulb break  it's considered almost like the waste site  it's very big  the bulbs  the new bulbs  they're very dangerous with all of the gases  and i said  ""what's the point "" well  then he said  ""well  i'm saying if we continue that production  they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that's better "" and there is a big danger  in fact they have labels  don't break this bulb  what do you do  you're going to throw it away  i promise i won't break it  all the new ones  so you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america  we'll be one united nation  we'll support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  thank you  law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy  are the true american way like you  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we will live by the words of our national motto  in god we trust  it'll stay there  we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who crossed the ocean  settled the continent  tamed the wilderness  revolutionized industry  pioneered science  won two world wars wars  defeated fascism and communism  put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world  we are great americans and the future belongs to us  the future belongs to you  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting and i'd like to fight a little less with these people but they just don't stop  they just keep coming at you in waves  they are unfortunately not the best people  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we're going to keep on winning  we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation  and ladies and gentlemen of north carolina  the best is yet to come  together we will

10,10,Sep,2020,datasets/Freeland,"we brought you a lot of car plants  michigan  we brought you a lot of car plants  you know that  right  long time  it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built  but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years  and we're going to bring you a lot more  that's happening  hello  michigan and i'm thrilled to be in freeland with thousands of loyal  hardworking american patriots  fifty-four days from now  we're going to win michigan  and we're going to win four more years in the white house  this is the most important election in the history of our country  joe biden devoted his career to offshoring michigan's jobs  outsourcing- we shouldn't be smiling about it  but we've changed it around  outsourcing michigan's factories  throwing open your borders  dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to china and other far away lands  biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century  including nafta  china  and dpp  you know that  joe biden surrendered your jobs to china and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night  if biden wins  china wins  if biden wins  the mob wins  if biden wins  the rioters  anarchist  arsonist and flag burners win  but i wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning  i don't think he's winning  this is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place  you do know that  the same thing happened four years ago  it was election eve but by the time i got here  it was late  some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day  we had 32 000 people show up and the reason i went is that i heard that crooked hillary clinton  bill clinton and barack hussein obama were traveling to michigan because they heard they had problems  they were supposed to win michigan  but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes  they came and i heard about it  they said  ""sir  could you do it "" i hopped in the plane  we landed at 12 o'clock in the evening  i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day  32 000 people  she had 500 people  i said  ""why are we going to lose michigan "" and we didn't  and we didn't  first time in a long time  but now we're up in the polls  we just saw polls  we're up in michigan  i don't know if that's good or bad  i don't know  i don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time  we won  so maybe we're better off being down a little bit  hello  john james  i see you handsome guy  john james  get out and vote for john  i'm going to introduce you in a second john james  what a job you've done  i have to tell you  he took  i saw this group of people that were running  all nice people  three very rich people and one guy that was john james and i saw them all  right  i saw them all and i said  ""wait "" with the wonderful invention of tivo  one of the greats  you can play it back  i said  ""who was that "" he said  ""i don't know  sir "" i said  ""play it back "" i said  ""that man is going to be a star "" it was john james  that was in the republican primary  after learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter  and he's a great  and actually a great flyer i heard the other day  a great one  a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good  but his incredible background and education at west point and all of the things he did  i said  ""this guy"" and i endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship  frankly  if he had a little more support  he would have won the last time  this time  i hear you're even  and maybe even ahead  and we're going to win with john james  he's a great guy  but i'm going to introduce him in a second  i'm running for reelection to keep jobs in michigan  we have got a lot of 窶ｦ last year before the china plague came in  we have the china plague  thank you china very much  should have never let that happen  they should have never  ever let it happen  they stopped it from going into china  but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the us  in europe and the rest of the world  188 countries  but it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it  we're going to remember it  but we had in michigan and in the country  the greatest economy in the history of the world  there has never been an economy  now  we're building it again and it's being built fast  by the way  it's turning out to be john  a super v  no more v  now it's starting out to be a super v  but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america  not to china  because if we win  america wins and that's what it's about  if we win  america wins  not only does joe biden want to eliminate your jobs  he wants to eliminate your borders  he's promised to flood your state with refugees  you know that as well as i do  you see it all the time  from terrorist hotspots around the world  including syria  somalia  and yemen  biden's pledged to have a 700% increase  he made this deal with crazy bernie  a 700% increase in the flow of refugees  so  he wants to lift it up by 700%  this is in their manifesto  he's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans  overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions  making matters worse  he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic  by the way  the wall  it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well  doing very well  make the mic louder  the mic louder  biden is waging war against the american middle class  i think most of you are not middle class  you're upper class  you're the elite  you know the way they talk about the elite  the elite  they're really elite  i see them  they're not elite  you're the elite  the elite has decided  boy  have we hurt the elite  haven't we now  you're the super elite  the left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you  it's very simple  over the last three and a half years  we've secured america's borders  blocked the entry of foreign terrorist  fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good  they are good  in fact  biden was interviewed today on 窶ｦ there they are  cnn  no  he was just interviewed today  he was interviewed by jake tapper who i find to be a nice guy  i don't think he likes me too much  but that's okay  he was interviewed on cnn and they said  ""which is better  nafta or the usmca "" he said  ""no  no  the usmca "" tapper goes  ""what "" couldn't believe it  he said usmca  he made a mistake  from his perspective  he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on  even though he's right  he doesn't know  there were a little surprised to hear that  they gave him a few chances  let's ask that question again  but we brought back our manufacturing jobs  we rebuilt the awesome power of the us military  we obliterated the isis caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world  now  we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before  before the end of the year  we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the china virus  i have a feeling 窶ｦ by the way  i think the vaccine is going to come very soon  going to come very soon  with it or without it  we're rounding the turn  you see what's happening  you see the numbers are plunging  you see how good we're doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world  but the fake news doesn't like saying that  they don't like telling you that  next year  unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes  raise your taxes  raise up all of those regulations that we cut  next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country  at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties  two visions  two philosophies  and two agendas for the future  there's never been a vision like this  you have sleepy joe and you have trump  sleepy joe  he's a beauty  he's a beauty  he's a beauty  i watched the democrat debates  right  i watched them up there and he was so bad  i said  ""there's no way he makes it "" it's sad  isn't it  the first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes  and she's a nice person  she meant this really  me  i view it differently  but she looked at  she watched the debate and she watched joe and she said  ""darling  it's so sad "" this was early on  this is the guy i'm running against  it's so sad  darling  it's so sad  but we got them  joe biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him  he doesn't know what platform  he doesn't  it's your radical left people  it's aoc plus three  it's all these people  bernie  it's bernie  it's kamala  the most liberal person in the us senate  i tell it all the time  she started off her poll numbers at 15  14  12  12  then she went back up to 12 and a half  then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out  she dropped out  but there's never been anything like this  no major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views  again  he took the manifesto drawn up by bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by  including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment  on november 3rd  michigan  you better vote for me  i got you so many damn car plants  i'll tell you what  i'll be so angry at you  i got you a lot of plants  is that right  i mean  have you seen how we're doing here  all the plants that have been built  are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded  they don't want to give you credit for that  they just expanded  i went to prime minister abe of japan  i say  ""prime minister  you have to start doing something "" he's a great guy  he'll be retiring soon  he's a great guy  the prime minister of japan  abe  i say  ""shinzﾅ  shinzﾅ  you have to do me a favor  you've got to send car plants over here  you're sending all those cars  we stupidly don't  now they've been building it for a number of years  but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years  they were the old plants  and it's been amazing what's happened in michigan  but honestly  it's been amazing what's happened in ohio and north carolina and south carolina and florida and new hampshire and so many other places  our country is doing great  we had to take a pause to get rid of the china virus  and we got rid 窶ｦ we're coming around  we're coming around that turn  i'm telling you  you watch  next year  better than last year  it's going to be better than last year  michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity  or whether we'll allow sleepy joe to impose  4 trillion in tax hikes  ban american energy  confiscate your guns  shut down the economy  and tell your governor to open up your state  it's all democrat governors  and i think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity  you'd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing  you got to open it up the state  and also  you have to have a governor because right now michigan's lagging  great football  great coach  great team  we want a governor  john james  that's going to let michigan play big ten football this year  you've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open big ten at my suggestion  how about sleepy joe  he said  ""donald trump is against football "" no  no  no  i'm the one that says open it up  let's play football  these people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it  they're liars  i'll tell you  they lie  but we have a good chance  you have a very good commissioner  and the commissioner is working hard  and hopefully  very soon they'll say you're going to play football  and i hope they're not leaving michigan out because it's never the same if they do  but you have maryland  where they have a problem in terms of playing  and the governors have a lot of power over that  they have a lot of power  a lot of say  so let's play big ten football  right  they want to shut down auto production  delay the vaccine  they want to destroy your suburbs  look at what i've done for your suburbs  you know what i've done  you know what i've done  does anybody want to have somebody from antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb  i don't think so too much  say  ""darling  who moved in next door "" ""oh  it's a resident of antifa "" ""no  thank you  let's get out of here  let's get the hell out of here  darling  let's leave our suburbs  i wish trump were president  he wouldn't have allowed that to happen "" and that's exactly right  i won't allow it to happen  the suburbs are the american dream  and i will tell you  i have protected your suburbs  i got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things  where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country  and i got rid of it  they said  ""sir  we can amend it and make it less crazy "" i said  ""no  i don't want to amend it  i don't want to do that  i want to get rid of it "" ""well  sir  why don't we just do a simple amendment  it would be"" 窶ｦ i said  ""i want to get rid of it  end it "" and we ended it  we ended it  i think the people living in the suburbs 窶ｦ which i know very well  i watched westchester in new york where they were doing things that should never have been done  and it's not going to happen to our suburbs  they want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in our schools  not going to happen  not going to happen  for the last four years  they've tried everything to stop us  and they are only getting more desperate by the day  can you imagine if on september 3rd  they say  ""ladies and gentlemen  donald trump has been declared the winner  donald trump has been declared"" 窶ｦ at first  they'll go crazy  and then they'll say  ""okay  it's time now to be reasonable "" they will have had it  they will have had it  we were coming together as a nation  very interesting  before the plague came in from china  we will coming together  it was success  somebody said  ""what's going to bring you together "" and it was  we were coming together  i was starting to get calls from democrats that 窶ｦ frankly  we didn't speak much  and i was starting to get calls  and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in  and we saw what was happening  and it really stopped things  but success was getting very  very close to bringing us all together  and then we had to say  ""let's take a time out  we got to fix this mess "" and we did  and now we're coming back strong  but success brings us together  and it was happening  and then we got that terrible situation happened  and we'll never forget it  biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through  in all cases  democrat-run cities  republican-run cities are doing very well  i hope you know that  and i hope you know  like in minneapolis  we were asked to come in  we went in  we took care of that problem in about  what  30 minutes  unfortunately  they let almost two weeks go by  and if you look at what we just did in wisconsin  which was so amazing  three days  and we went in  and by the way  the us marshals went in to get the killer  and that was the end of that  they got the killer  they got the killer  you know what i'm talking about  and we were going to go into seattle  the next day  we're all set  all lined up  looking forward to it  we just said  ""we're doing it "" i mean  they actually took over a part of the city  and the mayor said  ""this is going to be a summer of love "" right  where do these people come from  but we were all set to go in there  heard we were going in  we informed them we're going in  and they sent their police to do it  and we never even had to go in  but we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes  thank you  don't say that  i'll start to cry  and that wouldn't be good for my image  you don't want to see me cry  i'll start to cry  one of the fake news broadcasters  because this happened the other day  we had a tremendous crowd like this  i mean  we had a tremendous crowd in north carolina  they started chanting  ""we love you  we love you  we love you "" and it's incredible  they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections  they've never heard that chant that  ""we love you "" no  it's very nice  no  they've never heard it  true  now they'll say  ""he misrepresented  18 years ago  there was a rally held by somebody  and we heard the words from two people that  窶聾e love you  sir '"" now this is what we're dealing with  and by the way  i look out  there's a lot of people that 窶ｦ look at this  there's people back there that can't even get in  thank you  michigan  thank you  it's really nice to be with you  as president  i will always support the heroes of law enforcement  i was very honored to receive the endorsement of the police officers association of michigan  where are they  where are they  they're here someplace  where are they  thank you  fellows  that's really nice  i'll tell you  that's an honor  i have to be honest  i got it from florida  texas  ohio  north carolina  south 窶ｦ but michigan is michigan  thank you  i don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us  what is our poll number  99  i know they had 365 000 at one group  and they got a unanimous vote  i said  ""that's pretty good""  how can you go the other way  you people are fantastic  and we love you  thank you  that's great  thank you very much  appreciate it  biden says he wants to protect black lives  but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young african american citizens  thousands  the murder rate in democrat-run cities like chicago  baltimore  new york  so many others is higher than in afghanistan  yet biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide  you will have crime like you've never seen before  you'll have crime like you've never seen  last week  joe biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal portland district attorney  who has a policy of releasing rioters  criminals  and violent extremists without charge  biden's plan 窶ｦ and every time i say biden's plan  it's not his plan  it's the people that tell them what they're going to do  so please understand  i just don't want to say that every time i mention his name  so it should say  ""the people that control biden's plan"" is to appease domestic terrorists  my plan is to arrest them  to lock them up  if joe biden is elected  far left lunatics won't just be running failed democrat city  they'll be running the department of justice  the department of homeland security  and the united states supreme court  and we can't let that happen  no city  town  or suburb will be safe  on november 3rd  your vote will save america  remember  it's the most important election we've ever had  i'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in washington with the fake impeachment  the impeachment hoax  the russia  russia  russia hoax  somebody said russia's coming up again  adam schiff said  ""we'd like to find out about"" 窶ｦ i said  ""what about china  what about other countries "" it's always russia  russia  russia  they're at it again  i want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us  they love your state  and they love our country  congressman jack bergman  great job  jack  john moolenaar  thank you  john  great  great going  john  he's a tough cookie  and tim walberg  tim  thank you  great job  what great people  and i talked about him a little while before  i could talk about him all night  he's a star  he's going to be a future star  we have a very much different party than we had four years ago  we're now the party of the workers  we're the party of a lot of different things now  but we weren't really considered the party of the workers  certainly not anymore  remember this  we're the party of abraham lincoln  a lot of people forget that  honestly  remember when they used to say  ""he doesn't act presidential""  and i used to say  ""it's so easy to be presidential "" i'd only have about 10 or 15 people here  you'd be bored  but remember i used to do that  but i'd always say  ""i can be more presidential than any president in our history  except for the possibility of abraham lincoln when he wears his hat "" tough to beat  that's tough to beat  john james  but seriously  if you want to be well-represented 窶ｦ your current senator  i don't even know this guy  i don't even know this guy  nobody does  they don't know who he is  they don't even know  he comes into the office  i say  ""who is that guy "" i know every senator  democrat  republican  i don't know this guy  i know your other senator  i can tell by her hair  she's got interesting hair  but that was john's first crack  he learned a lot  and frankly  and i mean this  if he had more support from the republican party  he would've won that race  he would've  but this guy peters  right  peters  i say  ""who's peters "" nobody knows him  he doesn't do anything  i mean  look  we're going to end this  but i have to tell you  john james can be so great  he loves our country  he's been educated at the highest level  he was always the top at everything he's ever done  and this is what he has  and i'll be honest with you  john  i think i can tell this story  john and i were thinking about john  i was thinking about john more than myself because i know talent  and i said  ""john  you can run for a certain house seat  right  and you're guaranteed to win  you can run for another house seat  it'll be a tough race  but you're going to win  or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of  it's like a habit that they press that particular trigger  but that's a tough race  so you can be an absolute congressman  or you can take a shot at this one "" he said  ""sir  i can do more in the senate than i can do in the house "" and that was his decision  right  took a lot of guts  so john  i'm with you  you have my total and complete endorsement  you have everything i can do  everything i can do  we will do for you  and i really believe you're going to make it  you're running against somebody that is just ridiculous  folks  it's ridiculous  don't do it  also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job  helping our congressman  paul junge  where's paul junge  paul  thank you  good luck  i heard you're doing well  paul  paul junge  lisa mcclain  lisa  great job  it's going well  and eric essahki  thank you  eric  good luck  good luck  we're going to be out here helping you  too  we're going to be out here  i hope john doesn't even need help  but we're going to help john  too  we're going to help all of you  all right  we're going to be doing it  thank you  also with you is rnc chairwoman  she was the head of the whole state  and she kept calling me back  back  ""sir  one more speech  you're going to win michigan "" hadn't been won in decades  ""one more speech  sir  you're going to win michigan "" i said  ""all right  ron  i'm coming in one more time  but that's it "" i said  ""that woman is the most aggressive person i've ever met "" she said  ""i'm telling you  sir  one more speech "" i said  ""all right  i'll do it one more time  but that's it "" about a day after i got back  i said  ""i just got back from michigan  it was wonderful "" i get a call from ronna mcdaniel  and she goes  ""sir  could you come in tomorrow for another speech "" well  whatever happens  she is the one that got me here at midnight on 窶ｦ she is  so when it came time to picking the head of the rnc  as president  you have a couple of things to say about it  right  i said  ""who's that woman that kept getting me back to michigan  boy oh boy  she'll be great "" ronna mcdaniel  and somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead  maybe way ahead  they had a poll  i think it was a gallup poll  they said 62% of the people are lying about their poll  now  they're only lying having to do with my 窶ｦ and i don't know if i'm supposed to be insulted by that or not  but we'll take it  but we could have a very big win  and look  no president has done for michigan what president trump has done for michigan  and you're going to remember that  and i'm going to remember michigan  michigan gop chair laura cox  great  thank you  great job  great job  thank you  thank you very much  thanks  laura  we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years  47 years of bad votes  after the last administration nearly killed the us auto industry  i saved the us auto industry  joe biden supported the disastrous trans-pacific partnership  which would have been a death sentence for american auto jobs  i withdrew from the tpp my first week in office  that was so easy  that was so easy  you wouldn't have been making cars  you would've been buying cars from foreign lands  we have enough of that  biden supported the horrendous south korea deal that would've wiped out us production of the pickup truck  which is the most 窶ｦ the pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes  you know why  we have something called the chicken tax  does anyone know what i'm talking about  the chicken tax  it's a tariff of 25%  and it keeps other countries out of here  and it expired  and south korea didn't want to do it  but they did it  we got it right back  and we put it on for a long time  and now you're making 窶ｦ but remember this  go check it out  the chicken tax  i'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that  maybe you don't want to know about it  but we're keeping those small trucks  and we're keeping our whole industry good  and we're expanding our autos now  our cars  and we're doing a great job of it  and i want to thank everybody  doing a great job  and by the way  many other things in michigan  biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry  and i reversed that rule  i actually reversed it  and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car  the united states lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the obama-biden disaster  before the virus  my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants  how about 200  i didn't know that  200  200  i thought it was a little less than that  wait  i want to see that again  200  it's 窶ｦ 窶ｦ than that  wait  i want to see that again  200  it says 200  do you believable it  that's a lot  you know  i have a choice between teleprompter and freelance  i hate to say  the freelance is always a hell of a lot better  but 窶ｦ if you remember  and you remember well  i actually got elected because of freelance  we didn't have teleprompters  there were no teleprompters  but think of that  200  we're talking about 200 plants  i thought it was a much lower number  i thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number  at 200  you have no choice  yesterday  biden was in michigan  he said  ""i better get out of the basement "" this guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals  biden championed nafta  perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country  he continued to embrace and promote nafta for decades  i told you  he just said it was not as good as the deal i made  i can't believe  oh they're giving him hell tonight  they're giving him hell  what did you say that for  boy oh boy  yeah  hiding  窶労oe hiden ' look  this doesn't sound nice  i'll say it  and they'll criticize for it  you watch  but i have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics  i really believe that  i do  can you imagine if i lost to him  i'd have to say i lost to the worst candidate ever put up  don't do that to me  michigan  don't do that  biden supported china's entry into the world trade organization  which  by the way  was a disaster  china was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this world trade organization with all sorts of advantages  just a terrible  terrible situation took place  that's when china became a big  powerful economic power  but  if you look at the numbers just before the plague  now  the numbers are different  we were going up  up  up  we were beating them like a drum  they weren't even close  we were gaining  gaining  gaining  we were number one by far  you know  for years i've heard that in 2019  china was going to surpass us  well  in 2019  we gained a lot on them  we were doing great  we were doing great and we'll be doing even better next year  you watch  yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by joe biden's son  where's hunter  see his first name  i now name 窶ｦ his first name is where  where's hunter  he must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he's taken more money from more countries  he had no job and then he became rich  but where's hunter who facilitated the sale of a michigan automotive company to a leading chinese military defense contractor  does anyone know that china's military got yet another piece of american manufacturing  mike and the biden family made a lot of money on it  it was a lot of money  what about ukraine  he got  183 000 a month   3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy  working for an energy company  by the way  what's your experience  hunter  what's your experience with energy  ""i don't have any "" ""okay  we'll pay you 183 000 a month and i will give you an upfront payment  hunter  of  3 million  will that be satisfactory "" he goes  ""yes  i'll take it "" would anybody here not take that deal  anybody  please raise your head  this is one guy  right  you must be a pretty rich guy  if biden's elected  china will own america  washington vultures like biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state  michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that biden supported  by the way  i don't know if anybody 窶ｦ but does anybody remember like 12 years ago  long before i thought about running for president  when i enjoyed my life  i had the greatest life  ""where would we like to go  let's go to monte-carlo this weekend  let's go "" no  i had a great life  but i was honored  i was doing very well  i was honored in michigan  does anybody know that  i was given man of the year award by somebody  i came in and i spent like 45 minutes talking about how you've been ripped off  how all your auto companies are leaving and going to mexico and  by the way  to canada too  but how they're all leaving and going to mexico and canada  i spent the whole time talking about it  at the end i felt embarrassed  i said  ""i hope i haven't insulted the state too much  but why do you let this happen "" i stopped it  i stopped  it won't be happening  it won't be happening  it's not going to happen anymore  biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year  i kept my promise to michigan workers when we ended the nafta nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end  and when we signed that brand new us- mexico-canada agreement into law  the usmca includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan  now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave michigan  fire all of our workers  go to mexico or canada  make the car or the product  send it in here without tariffs  we end up with closed factories  no job and no taxes  that's not happening anymore  that's not happening anymore  but do you remember how bad it was just before i took office  it was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country  i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of michigan jobs  biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging  just so you know  china's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month  before me  china never paid anything  they didn't pay us 25 cents  you know what i did with some of that money  i gave it to our farmers  i don't know if we have a lot  do we have farmers here  we have farmers  raise your hands farmers  that's not bad no  i gave  28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by china  they were targeted  they said  ""you know 窶ｦ"" and that's what they did in the past to other presidents  they said  ""if you do this  we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the midwest and all of that "" i said  ""you know what  i do  whatever you want "" then i went to sonny perdue  secretary of agriculture  a great guy  i said  sonny  ""how much are they being targeted for "" ""sir   12 billion the first year  two years  three years ago  and then 16 billion  a total of 28 billion "" i said  ""that's okay  we're putting tariffs on everything they send into our country  25% "" was going to raise it to 50%  also  10% at 12%  all different tariffs  we took in billions and billions  and i said  ""you know what we're going to do  we're going to take  of that  the 12 and the 16   28 billion and we're going to give it to our farmers who were targeted "" and our farmers are doing great  that's what we did  do you think joe biden would do that  he wouldn't have a clue  hillary wouldn't have had a clue  crazy bernie wouldn't have  nobody would add a clue on that one  by the way  we had tens of billions of dollars left over  you know what i did with that  we gave it to the us treasury  right smack into the heart of the us treasury  and we're still getting those big tariffs  even though we made a trade deal with china  i said  ""no  you got to leave the tariffs on "" a lot of people didn't know it  schumer went  ""well  i don't like to do 窶ｦ"" first of all  he didn't like tariffs  and then all of a sudden he loves it  but when i made the deal with china  i left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts  when i left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it  i said to schumer  ""what do you think of the deal "" ""i don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs "" i said  ""no  we left the tariffs on "" this is what it is  no matter how you do it  no matter how good the deal  they'll say  ""it's no good "" because they don't love the country  they don't love the country  remember that  joe biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in the usa  that's a nice plane  somebody said to me  ""your plane's just as nice as that "" i said  ""no  it's not  that's air force one  that's the nicest "" always  that's the nicest  i also authorize millions of dollars to save michigan soo locks  and forget all the problems they had  for years and years  they fought over the money to do it  we got  300 million to the great lakes restoration initiative  and we have done a job on the soo locks  they were rotting you  weren't going to have anything come through the soo locks  it's all done  that deal is all done  it's all done  right  thank you  thank you  where are my guys there  good job  right  even though you're law enforcement  that's a good job  right  two months ago  i also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the edenville dam  where are the people from edenville  yeah  good  no  that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now  we're providing more than  43 million in federal funds to help homeowners  businesses and communities in central michigan to recover from that catastrophe  thank you  perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration  under my administration  we've achieved the most secure border in american history  we've ended catch and release  stopped asylum fraud  and we've deported over 20 000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens  as i said  we've already built over 310 miles of border wall  it's all going to be finished very quickly  we're averaging about 10 new  brand new  beautiful miles every single week  it'll be finished very short  we've invested  2 5 trillion in the us military  all made in the usa  by the way  all made in the usa  you know  with the fake news today  i said  ""and we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech  we have systems that you've never even seen before  president xi has nothing like it  putin has nothing like it  nobody has anything like what we have "" they said  ""is he giving away military information "" no  i'm saying  ""we have the greatest weapons in the world "" that's what i'm saying  they said  ""he may be giving away classified information "" you don't have to worry about it  these people are sick  never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information  now  i just want to let people know  we have the greatest systems  the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world  there's nobody like the us military  we have the most powerful military in the world  when i took it over  it was depleted  it was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous  endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years  and you know  those soldiers are starting to come home very big  you know that right  we passed the mission act  we call it va choice and va accountability  we hold people accountable if they don't treat our vets good  you're fired  get out  you're fine  we did more in 47 months than sleepy joe biden did in 47 years  that's true  we did more  that sort of has a nice ring to it  right  think of it  we did more and it's true  just take a look  space force  by itself  that would be a major achievement  and with us  we did so many things  so many things  but we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years  it's true  it's true  a lot of what i did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did  including regulations all over the place  i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  we paid  150 billion  1 8 billion in cash  we ought to speak to law enforcement about that  how do we send 1 8 billion in cash  in cash  you guys ought to take a look at that please  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it  for decades and decades  they all said  i tell this story  it was a hard thing to get done  it was easy to talk about in the campaign  ""we're going to open up the embassy in jerusalem  we're going to make it  it becomes automatically the capital of israel "" everybody said it for very  very many decades  for decades  many presidents  but i realize now why it was an effort because as soon as i got in  i was lobbied by everybody  ""please don't do it  don't do it  don't make the capital of israel jerusalem  don't move your embassy "" so went on and on  then i said  ""let's do it anyway "" it's true  and the word got out  the word got out that i was going to do it  and i was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every 窶ｦ everybody was calling me  ""please sir  don't do it  please "" so i did what we sometimes will do in business  i told them 窶ｦ when a king calls  when somebody calls  an emir  when somebody calls  tell them  ""i'll call them back in a few days  i'm sorry  sir  he won't be able to speak right now  he'll call you back on wednesday  okay  thank you very much  i appreciate it "" on tuesday  i announced that i'm doing it  then i got on the phone with 18 different companies  i go  ""hey  how you doing  you called  i'm just returning your call "" ""oh  it's too late  sir  we called about israel  it's too late "" i said  ""gee  i'm sorry  i wish you got to me a little bit sooner "" i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in middle east peace in decades  and by the way  on wednesday  i believe of next week  prime minister  benjamin netanyahu  and as you know  the country  a very powerful  very respected country with a great leader  the uae  is coming to the white house and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades  it's peace and its recognition of israel and all of the things  nobody thought it could be done  it's an amazing thing  i don't say this out of ego  but i was nominated for the nobel peace prize  now  i have to tell you  that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it  could you imagine  when obama came to office  they said  ""we're going to give him the nobel peace prize "" he actually said  ""what did i do  i didn't do anything "" he didn't do anything for eight years  frankly  but he said  ""what did i do "" they gave it to them in a matter of weeks  right  weeks  with us  we've done so much  we have done so much on so many different fronts  remember north korea  remember  they were going to be at war with north korea  where's the war  where's the war  where's the war  and we have a good relationship with kim jong-un  who knows what happens  all i know is  we're not in war and that's okay  they said  ""but he gave away so much "" i said  ""i gave away nothing "" ""no  he gave away so much "" when i said  ""what did they give away "" you know what they said  ""uh  we don't know "" i said  ""here's what i gave away  i gave away nothing "" they said  ""oh  but you agreed to meet "" oh  i see  i agreed to meet  so now they're saying  ""i agreed to meet  it was such a big deal "" instead of being in a war  i think agreeing to meet is okay  right  and we did  he's a different kind of a guy and he's a smart guy  a very smart guy  we get along  getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing  we're trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years  these fools  these fools  you know  you got nuclear weapons  you got big armies  big navies  ""he gets along with putin  that's a terrible thing "" no  it's a good thing  if i get along  that's good  he likes me  i like him  not so bad  ""he gets along with kim jong-un "" 窶ｦ not so bad  he gets along with kim jong-un  that's a terrible thing  no  it's a good thing  i'm trying to convince him  it's okay  it's okay not to go to war  it's really okay  he gets along with president xi  he gets along with prime minister abe  he gets along with a lot of people  and it's okay  that's a good thing  it's really hard  these stupid people that have been running this operation for 30  40 years  and they come out against me  and all they did was stick us in these endless wars  we're fighting for sand and blood  sand and blood  syria  what do you get out of it  you get sand  you get blood  you get injuries  you get death  these people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons i got elected  i can tell you that  we don't like his foreign policy  and this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in iraq  got us into the middle east  so  it's 窶ｦ we're doing a great job  we're doing a great job for you  we're doing a great job for michigan  just to finish in the middle east  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  and by the way  we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully  if we do get into war  we win the war  we don't fight for nothing  we fought for nothing  we don't ever want to have war but if there is a war  nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us  and we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe  you people know that a lot better than the idiots in washington that has represented us for 35 years  we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops  qasem soleimani is dead  we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home  and they're coming home very rapidly  you see that  sleepy joe biden voted for the iraq war  he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military  destroyed our military  set us back so many years  i got rid of it immediately  he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he was against it  everything he did  he was wrong on as said by gates  you know  secretary of defense  secretary of everything  he was sort of like 窶ｦ he had more jobs than any human being i've ever seen  but he said  ""everything  everything that biden was for was wrong "" he opposed killing soleimani  he oversaw the rise of isis  he was unable to do anything with isis  as he came to the white house two weeks ago  and we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of china as a positive development  remember  he said  ""no  it's a positive development for america and for the world "" he's been in washington for 47 years now  he's all of a sudden going to change  he's going to change  he's not going to change  don't forget  he was in washington in his primetime  which was never considered great  and now it's no longer primetime  when i banned travel from china  biden called it hysterical and xenophobic  if we had listened to joe  hundreds of thousands more americans would have died from the china plague  biden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders  and now joe biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories  putting millions of lives around the world at risk  and the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine  so  he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant  who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators  after we invoked the defense production act  and they've done a fantastic job  not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country  they needed a ventilator  we had nothing  we were left  bare cupboards  i always say the cupboards were bare  we're delivering lifesaving therapies  and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world  europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the united states  you don't hear that from the fake news  hey  america will prevail over the china virus  as franklin delano roosevelt said  ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself "" that's it  we're doing very well  as the british government advised the british people in the face of world war ii  ""keep calm and carry on "" that's what i did  this whack job that wrote the book  he said  ""well  trump knew a little bit "" they wanted me to come out and scream  ""people are dying  we're dying "" no  no  we did it just the right way  we have to be calm  we don't want to be crazed lunatics  we have to lead  when hitler was bombing  i don't know if you know this  when hitler was bombing london  churchill  great leader  would oftentimes go to a roof in london and speak  and he always spoke with calmness  he said  ""we have to show calmness "" no  we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody  all of those great generals  all of those great admirals  our great vice president  mike pence  they did a fantastic job  our doctors  and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to november 3rd  but we've done a fantastic job  i think we've probably done the best job of any country  certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic  through our historic relief programs  we've saved more than 1 6 million michigan jobs  and over 128 000 michigan businesses  michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost  and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue  she's like joe  you would have regained far more than that  open up your state  madam governor  open up your state  let's go  just like crazy nancy pelosi  your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules  her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on memorial day weekend while she was ordering the people of michigan to stay in their homes  and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right  the biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now  he would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry  you know  on regulations  it took  in many cases  18  19  20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved  we have it down now to two years  we're trying to get it down to one year  and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons  but we're going to know about it very fast  no more 20 year approvals or disapprovals  he wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens  he will destroy your social security  he will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions  and we will save social security  remember they said last time  ""oh  trump is going to destroy social security "" well  it's now four years  we haven't touched it  we've protected it  and that's going to remain that way  biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected  charter schools  so important  are gone  in a second term  i will provide school choice to every parent in america  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  and a limitless future for all americans  instead of letting washington change us  despite all that we have been through  we are changing washington  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  and right here in michigan  we will enact fair trade deals that create american jobs and grow american wages  we will rapidly return to full employment  soaring incomes and record prosperity  and that's already happening  we will hire more police  increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement  surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities  and we will ban sanctuary cities  we will appoint prosecutors  judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law  not their own political agenda  we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race  color  religion and creed  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech  and the right to keep and bear arms  and you're lucky i'm here because you're second amendment would be gone if i wasn't  and they didn't touch it  we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens  and we will keep out people  keep them out of these horrible  horrible situations where they hurt our country  they hurt the people of our country  and we're also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you've never even heard of  we will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense  we've already got it  pretty much  and we will maintain peace through strength  we will end surprise medical billing  require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it's all signed and it goes into effect on january 1st  you better make sure i win  can you imagine  this is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is  you'll figure it out  price transparency  did they fight me on that one  january 1st  and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before  i've already signed it  favored nations  the drug companies are not happy  i will tell you  just  all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me  favored nations  where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world  we pay that number  we will protect medicare and social security  and we will always protect our patients  we will always our people  we will your pre-existing conditions  as i said  america will land the first woman on the moon  and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  we will restore patriotic education  you know what i mean by that  and we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto  in god we trust  and i don't know if you saw it  but during the democrat national convention and caucus  they took twice  i thought i was sort of  maybe they made a mistake  you saw that  they took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance twice  and then they said  ""oh  well maybe it was a mistake "" it wasn't a mistake  that's where they're coming from  don't be foolish  that's where they're coming from and there's nothing that sleepy joe biden can do about it  for years  you had a president who apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for michigan  so  get your friends  get your family  get your neighbors and your coworkers  and get out and vote  so important  from grand rapids to saginaw  from kalamazoo to mackinac  and from flint to right here in freeland  we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood  sweat and tears for this beloved nation  this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line  it's the place where general motors  chrysler and kellogg revolutionized entire industries  michigan  well  you know this one  right  michigan gave us motown  right  that's right  that's right  motown  we love motown  michigan gave us motown  gave us motown  gave us the mustang and the unrivaled might of the american midwest  this is the state where tough  strong and determined workers made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  and we are making it greater and greater every single day  proud citizens like you helped build this country  and together  we will be taking back our country  we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete  we have to win on november 3rd  we're returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are going to keep on winning  vote

11,17,Jul,2019,datasets/Greenville,"thank you very much  thank you  thank you  thank you to greenville  north carolina  i want to thank you  and to  mike pence  you've done a great job  great vice president  thank you mike  and we have all night  we're going to have a lot of fun tonight  and i have nothing to do  nothing  nothing  we have nothing to do but make our country great again  and that's happening fast  it's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking north carolina patriots  and thank you for your support  thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago  time is flying  you getting ready  let's do it again  right  let's do it again  i just heard that the united states house of representative  has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project i've ever been involved in  the resolution  how stupid is that  own impeachment  i want to thank those democrats because many of them voted for us  the vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1  332 to 95  think of it  we have the strongest economy in history  the lowest unemployment numbers ever  we've rebuilt the most powerful military  it was totally depleted when i took office  and now it's rebuilt  we passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history  we took care of our great vets  including veterans choice  and veterans accountability  and they want to try and impeach  it's a disgrace  it's a disgrace  so now we have that behind us  and i have to say this  and i'll say it just once  what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the united states  never  ever again  i want to thank republican leadership for what they've done for all of us  by stopping that hoax  the russian hoax i call it  because america is winning again  america's respected again  and  because we are finally putting america first  our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words  jobs  jobs  jobs  we've created 6 million new jobs since election day  if i would have said that  nobody would have believed it  if i would've said that  the fake news would have said he's exaggerating  and i wouldn't have said it because i wasn't even sure we could do it  think of it  6 million jobs since election day  think of it  and by the way  north carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state  our country has added more than 180 000 people to the workforce  and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis  you picked up over 180 000 jobs  north carolina  think of that  and you have your lowest unemployment rate  you have a lot of good things  but let's not talk too much about north carolina  let's win this election nationwide  you remember north carolina  that was going to be the clinton firewall  she spent a fortune here  and i kept coming in and coming out  they call it  earned media  i earned it  i kept coming in and coming out  and every time i left they said  ""i don't think we'll lose in north carolina "" you know what  i was right  we won it  we won it easily  we won it easily  so i just want to thank everybody  seriously  this is a big窶ｦ that was a big deal  november 8th  that was a big deal  donald trump has won the great state of north carolina  a big deal  that was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention  beautiful looking place  one of the most beautiful venues i've ever seen  but i don't want any part of it  it was unlucky  i don't want any part  but that's when you saw the people say  what the hell is going on  what  what's happening  and then it was state after state  it was florida  it was south carolina  we love south carolina  right  unbelievable  it was pennsylvania  remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in pennsylvania  so there was 1% of the vote remaining  if i lost every one of those votes  we still win by a lot  and they wouldn't announce it  they wouldn't announce it  and then we won the great state of wisconsin  first time in many  many decades  that a republican won  and then we had a surprise  but not a surprise to us  because we're bringing back the auto industry  we brought so much back to the great state of michigan  that was a shocker  remember that  do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said  ""you know this sport is getting awfully red "" that's republican  ""there's a lot of red up there "" we had a lot of窶ｦ that was one hell of a night  wasn't it though  one hell of a night  i think it was maybe  you know there are those that say  one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything  and you know  you can go  all over the world in some cases  it was morning  you go to asia  you go to europe  you go all over  it was just record setting and here's the point  we have to do it again  we have to do it again  and the reason we have to not only to do new things  which we will  and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head  can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax  i don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you  i think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever< first two and a half years  but could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt  you said it  he said it  i won't say it because it's a harrell  it's a terrible word  so i will not say that this guy said  if we didn't have the bullshit  that's all  no  no  could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything  can you imagine  and you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well  is that possible  that can happen  maybe we would have had too much time on our hands  who knows  but i can say  nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we  not me  what we've all done  it's true  the unemployment rate among african americans is the lowest in the history of our country  unemployment among hispanic americans  where we're doing really well  you know why  because they want a strong border  they want it because they understand the border better than anybody  they want that strong border  they want that wall that's being built right now  they want that wall  and they really do  they understand the border better than anybody  and they don't want criminals coming in  they don't want crime coming  they don't want to lose their jobs  they like the fact that their salaries are going up  their wages are going up  they understand it better  so hispanic american  the best unemployment numbers in our history  asian americans  the best unemployment numbers in our history  and likewise women  74 years  so i'm sorry women  i let you down  it's not in our history  but we're going to be there very soon  we're going to be there very soon  women are doing incredibly and women窶ｦ the men are going to get angry  sorry men  whoa  look at all those signs  women for trump  wow  thank you  that's a lot of signs  you remember last election  donald trump will never ever get the women  then we got this tremendous number of women  we got this tremendous number of women  and during the election night  they say  ""what's going on "" you know it's called suppression polls  suppression  polls are just as fake as the news itself  but women filled 60%  and i'm sorry to tell you this  men  they're going to sue me for discrimination now  women fill 60% of all of the new jobs created last year  women took 60%  what's wrong with you  men  what's wrong with you  but the radical democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement  and our country's tremendous success  unprecedented  we've had unprecedented success  leaders come in from other countries  prime ministers  presidents  kings  queens  dictators  sometimes  i hate to say it  dictators  and they all start off by saying  ""mr  president  i'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created  the greatest anywhere in the world by far "" and sadly  china who i have a very good relationship with president xi  i really like him  but china has had窶ｦ yesterday it was announced  the worst year in 27 years  we've had the best  and if our opponent ever got into office  instead of being up  62% instead of those 401ks of yours being up 60  70  80  90%  crash  big crash  you would have had a crash  the likes of which we have never seen before  if they got in office  because we freed up our country  we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts  but also with those big beautiful tax cuts  we freed it up  the leading voices of the democrat party are left wing extremists  who reject everything our nation stands for  but again  i have to tell you  this vote was so big  i have to thank many of the democrats  i mean  that was amazing  no  no  i really do  i respect it  i really do  that was a slaughter  but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack  a real sneak attack  many of those people that voted for us were democrats  and i want to thank them  because they did the right thing for our country  republicans know that america is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world  but these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil  the way they speak  so badly of our country  they want to demolish our constitution  weaken our military  eliminate the values that built this magnificent country  you have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about  when you see the four congress women  oh  isn't that lovely  i'll give you just a couple  i've had pages and pages  but we don't want to bore you  we don't want to go too long  but we have to give a couple  because that's the great thing about live television  they can't cut it  representative ilhan omar  of a really great state  i almost won the first time in decades and decades  minnesota  greg stanton  by the way  i keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left  i don't think they have enthusiasm  they're just fighting with each other  we have all of the enthusiasm  he goes home now to mommy  and he gets reprimanded  and that's the end  sorry mommy  sorry mom  didn't mean to embarrass your mom  but it's true  we have the enthusiasm folks  look at this  look at this  and by the way  thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn't get in  thousand  we've got all the enthusiasm  they're fighting each other  they've gone so far left  nobody wants to even think about it  so representative omar  blames the united states  for the terrorist attacks on our country  saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs  she smeared us service members involved in black hawk down  in other words  she slandered the brave americans who were trying to keep peace in somalia  omar minimized the september 11th attacks on our homeland  saying some people did something  i don't think so  some people did something  yeah  some people did something  all right  she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization  she was looking for compassion  omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that  you don't say america with this intensity  you say  al-qaeda makes you proud  al-qaeda makes you proud  you don't speak that way about america  and at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported al-qaeda  that's our enemy  that's our enemy  they are a very serious problem that we take care of  but they always seem to come along somewhere  she refused to answer  she didn't want to give an answer to that question  omar blamed the united states for the crisis in venezuela  i mean think of that one  and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking american  saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country  and obviously and importantly  omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens  when she talked about the evil israel  and it's all about the benjamins  not a good thing to say  so that's omar  that's omar  and by the way  many other things  all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen  and you'll see thing after窶ｦ you didn't hear this over the last two days or did you hear anybody talk about this  her colleague representative rashida tlaib  agreed with omar's characterization of 9/11 and said that members of congress who support israel forgot  what country they represent  and tlaib also used the f word to describe the presidency and your president  that's not nice  even for me  she was describing the president of the united states and the presidency with the big fat vicious  the way she said it  vicious f-word  that's not somebody that loves our country  representative alexandria ocasio-cortez  check out her scores by the way  with her green new deal  the green new deal  where did that come from  she's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement  she compared american border agents managing a humanitarian crisis  that i always said was a humanitarian crisis  and they said it was manufactured  they don't say it was manufactured  and we're stopping it and i want to thank mexico  they've got 21 000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country  but cortez  somebody said that's not her name it's窶ｦ they said that's not her name  sir  i said  ""no  no  i don't have time to go with three different names "" we'll call her cortez  too much time  takes too much time  so cortez also  she said essentially nazis are running concentration camps  and when mike pence went down just a few days ago with members of congress and the media  and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps  they said  ""wow  these places a clean  wow  they have air conditioning  they have water "" and you know  to be honest  it's not like they came and we want to take care of people  we got to straighten out our immigration laws  you know  in a very short period of time  if the democrats would give us a few votes  we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great  it would be so great  but these kids and these people come from rough places  and i'll tell you what  some of them said  ""we've never lived like this before "" they have water  they have air conditioning  they have things that they've never seen  and we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets  which was a lie  which was a lie  cortez said that illegal immigrants are more american than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be  can you believe that  that's what she say  she described contemporary america  that's you  that's me  that's all of us  as garbage  garbage  a garbage  remember deplorables  right  that sounds worse  i think that's worse  but we'll save it for whoever's going to be the nominee  and right now  sleepy joe's not looking too good  pocahontas  pocahontas is gaining a little bit  because we probably use the pocahontas a little bit too early  but that's okay  we'll bring it out of retirement very soon  they have a new one who knocked the hell out of biden during the debate  he said  ""i wasn't prepared for that question "" that's not a good answer  can you imagine  and according to the polls  i won every single debate republican and against hillary  can you imagine  those are the polls  they won't admit that  many  many polls  but can you imagine if i said  ""uh-oh  i'm sorry i wasn't prepared for that question "" i'm gone  that's the end of trump  he's not prepared  he's not mentally prepared  that's his problem  but everybody that knows him knows that  but no harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing  what i would say that's pretty easy  and he choked  he choked  and then he said  ""ah  yeah  i'm sorry i ran out of time  i ran out of time"" he ran out of time  and then you have a young guy  buttigieg  buttigieg  they're saying how to say his name  buut-ih-jij  he's a beauty  he runs a failed city  his city is doing so badly  mike pence was the governor of that state  i said  ""how was he as the mayor "" mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet  and mike said  he never did a good job  i'm so shocked to see him running  okay  and then he goes back home  and african americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he's supposed to be like a hot young star  if that's a hot young star  i guess i just don't no star anymore  that is not as star  that's not a star  buut-ih-jij  you say  buut  and then add ih-jij  buttigieg  i don't see him dealing with president xi of china  i don't see him meeting successfully with kim jong-un  i don't see him dealing  and nobody has been tougher with russia than donald trump  i don't know see him dealing with vladimir putin  and we have good relationships with them and many others  except now we're no longer the suckers  like with nato  we protect europe  we spent hundreds of billions of dollars and they're not paying their fair share  so last year i went and said  ""folks  sorry  you got to pay your fair share "" 16 years was going like this  the contribution  and now it's like a rocket ship   100 billion  i said to him  great people  28 nations  including the us  i said to him  ""listen  we're taking care of you  you screw us on trade  and you don't pay your military bills  this is not a good deal for the united states "" so we're taking care of trade  we want to do it nice and slow and easy  you know  we got a world balance  but european union is terrible to us on trade  terrible  frankly  they're as tough or tougher than china  just smaller in numbers  that's the only difference  with china  507 billion dollars  a you look over the years  for many  many years  they've been taken  and guys like biden say  ""uh-oh  we'd them them "" and he was there eight years  ""we'd stop that "" no  trump is stopping it  trump is stopping it  representative ayanna pressle  is she related in any way to elvis  i don't know  who knows  you never know  she thinks that people with the same skin color  all need to think the same or military  you know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera  who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that  they're very brave  they always show up with a mask and they're covered  because then they go home to mom and dad  they don't want mom and dad to know where they were  but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well  right  they're attacking this group  they're not attack north carolina  that's for sure  so these congresswomen  their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left  but that's so  they are very evil  they're hitting people over the head with sticks  and i mean sticks  i mean bats even  they're whacking people with bats  they're very brave  they always show up with a mask and they're covered  because then they go home to mom and dad  they don't want mom and dad to know where they were  but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well  right  they're attacking this group  they're not attack north carolina  that's for sure  so these congresswomen  their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left  but that's okay  because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before  and tonight i have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists  who are constantly trying to tear our country down  they never have anything good to say  that's why i say  ""hey  if they don't like it  let them leave  let them leave  let them leave  let them leave "" they're always telling us how to run it  how to do this  how to the窶ｦ you know what  if they don't love it  tell them to leave it  i don't know  and i'll watch  i'll go back to the  ""oh sir  that was so controversial  sir "" no  i'm just saying it's their choice  they can come back when they want  but you know  they don't love our country  i think in some cases they hate our country  and it's so angry  even yesterday they went on the stage  i said  ""let me watch this "" and the anger  they were trying to be nice  but it's hard  it's hard for them to do that  that choice for every american has never been more clear  that's true  the democrat agenda is anti worker  anti jobs  anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense  with the exception of all of those democrats that voted for us today  we'll give them up  okay  they're fine  they're fine  they are fine and you'll lose to them  it's different  it's okay  it's called normal political back and forth  but i want to tell you something  the democrats are being violent  so vicious  moving so far left  it's out of control  it's out of control  the republican agenda is pro-worker  pro-jobs  pro-family  pro-growth  and 100% pro-american  so we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several north carolina republican leaders  really great people  they've been so helpful to me and they're doing an incredible job  lieutenant governor  dan forest  lieutenant governor  north carolina  treasurer dale folwell  greenville mayor  pj connelly  i hear he does a good job  pj  and north carolina gop chair  michael whatley incredible ncaa wrestling champion  great guy  he wanted to stay back  i said  ""you sure you don't want to come "" ""i do want to come  but i really want you to win today  if you don't mind "" i said  ""okay  you better stay back  if i see you here i'm going to be very angry "" and they did their job  didn't they  this man is from the great state of ohio  congressman jim jordan  we're going to do this quickly  but it's just important that you get out and vote  they're two great people  i want to introduce the next member of congress from north carolina's third congressional district  just won a great race  dr  greg murphy  greg is a winner  so you know greg would be great on jobs  all the things you want  tough on crime  strong on borders  pushing the wall  he'll be pushing it like nobody  we're building the wall but we're pushing it  it's like pulling teeth  we've got six lawsuits on the wall  we've won two of them  we're going to win others  but you think it's easy  don't you folks  you think this is easy  but we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one  it's so important it's going before the supreme court  we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year  so go out  get greg elected  great victory  by the way  that was a great primary and a great victory  that same day there's another crucial election in north carolina's 9th窶ｦ right  you know what we're talking about  9th  i know it's not here  but it's very close  right  9th congressional district  the democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named dan mccready  he wants to take away your guns  he wants to raise you taxes  he doesn't care about borders  he likes open borders  and he really admires socialism  i don't think that works too well in north carolina  doesn't work too well in our country  we're joined tonight by the republican candidate who is really a special man  a great man  he's going to be a great  great congressman  dan bishop  dan  thank you  dan  thank you dan  and he will indeed defend your values  your family  and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents  they're really into destroying our second amendment  who've been violently operating for more than 10 years  we got them all  we think they are no good  with conducting brutal  medieval style killings  you know what medieval style is  okay  little pieces  little pieces  little pieces  medieval style  including the dismemberment of their victims  and they enjoyed every minute of it  these are sick people  when i call them animals  nancy pelosi said  ""how dare he used that name  these are human beings "" i don't think they're human beings  most of those indicted were in our country illegally  19 to be exact  19 of 22  think of that  they want to protect窶ｦ these are savage beasts  these are savage killers  and they should've been brought out a long time ago by the obama administration  we're bringing ms-13 out by the thousands  getting them the hell out of our county  and when you read about deportation and sunday  we've got a lot of people on sunday  but we have a lot of people窶ｦ and we're always shooting for the bad ones first  which makes sense  right  but when you hear about that  we always want to get窶ｦ and by the way  do you know how dangerous it is for these ice agents  these ice and border patrol  but ice  they go into a nest  they call it a nest  a nest of these killers  they're tough  they're smart  and you know what  they're great patriots  they love our country  the danger that they have is incredible  and i just want to salute窶ｦ and i have to tell you  i want to salute ice and border patrol  and i want to support and salute law enforcement in the united states  these are great people  these are great people and they don't get the credit that they deserve  but you know what  i tell them all the time  you have no idea how much the american people  the american public  you have no idea how much they love you and respect you  law enforcement  in the recent democratic debate  every single candidate  everyone  biden was a little bit slower with the hand  it didn't work so well  they raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare  they raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that i don't think you're going to be happy with  illegal aliens will be very nicely covered  how about california  they just approved a  100 million  they just approved  100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants  and then you look on the sidewalks of los angeles  the sidewalks of san francisco  nancy pelosi's district  nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there  so if you don't want democrats to raid your healthcare  to steal away your money  to bankrupt your country  then you have a choice  you must vote republican  all american citizens  including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country  who study  who wait on line sometimes for 10 years  and who respect our laws and follow the rules  they deserve a government that is loyal to them  they work hard  you can't say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders  open borders are a disaster  human trafficking  the first time i heard as a politician  human trafficking  nobody talks about it  it sounded almost like an ancient crime  many  many years ago  hundreds of years  thousands of years ago  human trafficking  it's the worst now throughout the world because of the internet  it's the worst it's ever been  and the worst treated of all  children  but it's women  women  the democrats want to do nothing about it  human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world  not just窶ｦ this is not a united states problem  this is all over the world  human trafficking  it's a terrible  terrible thing and we got to solve it  most of it comes through  in this country  our southern border where we don't have the wall  they're not going through our points  they're not going through areas where we have security  where we have guards  where we have gates  where we have all sorts of equipment  no  they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don't have the wall  it's so simple  everybody knows it  the democrats all know it because five years ago before i was here  they all wanted it  now they don't want it  you know why they don't want it  for political reasons  and you know what  it's going to cost them a lot of points in the election  i think probably cost them the election itself  just lastly  democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets  where we just picked up these 22 thugs  these 22 monsters  we just picked him up in  where  los angeles  sanctuary city  wonderful sanctuary city  thom tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give american victims the right to pursue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered  they've shattered these lives  thank you very much thom  every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in it's national interest  it's very simple  isn't it  it's common sense  it's so simple and the voters understand that  we expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws  revere our constitution  cherish our history  support themselves financially  and embrace our american values and love our american flag  we believe in an immigration system based on merit  merit  where they come in  we have so many companies coming in  automobile companies  companies of all types  and we need workers  we actually need workers  we have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years  soon it'll be the lowest ever  we need workers  but they have to come in where they can help our country  they have to come in based on merit  and we're putting in bills and let's see what happens  otherwise  we'll just wait til we win back the house  win the senate  win the presidency  and we'll vote  democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream  they're going crazy folks  they're going crazy  more than 130 democrats in congress have signed up for bernie sanders total government takeover of healthcare  isn't that nice  this is one of the great窶ｦ it won't happen  he knows that  the guy never passed the bill  he did nothing  he's actually not even a democrat  isn't he an independent  i don't know  he's running but窶ｦ he missed his time  hey bernie  let me save you a lot of time and effort  bernie  you missed your time  it got taken from you four years ago  bernie  not doing too well  he's not doing too well  but that's okay  i got to hand it to him he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic  i said to our first lady the other day  i was watching bernie and he's screaming  his hair's all crazy  i'm going to do this  i'm going to do that  no more college loans  no more cost for anything  nothing  you're not going to pay for anything  he's desperate now  he's desperate  you don't have to pay for anything  i joke  i said  ""and everybody will get a free rolls-royce  every family gets a free rolls-royce  every family  and the media said  ""donald trump is exaggerating  he knows that they're not getting a rolls-royce "" i'm sorry  don't put it  don't put that i said free rolls royce  but bernie's desperate now  i watch him up there it's a sad situation  but i think they're all sad when you get right down to it  for instance  we're in this incredible state north carolina  that you have your best economy that you've ever had  forget the country for a second  you have the best economy you've ever had  you have your best unemployment numbers  you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state  you have your best black unemployment numbers  best hispanic unemployment numbers  best women unemployment numbers  best asian unemployment numbers  whoever the opponent is  what are they going to do is just say  ""north carolina  i'm going to do a great job  you have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state  so i don't know  and we won by a lot  and we won by a lot i was telling mike  i was telling my son eric trump and lara's here  y the way  who was born in north carolina  they do a good job  lara  do you love this state  and her brother's here  i have to tell you  he went to this college  and brad parscale is here  the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world  he's the tallest in the history  but most importantly  he's the best  the worlds tallest manager but he's the best manager  thank you  brad  great job  and he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof  he just told me that so i'll take that  we are a year and a half away  but we're doing well  you see it  you'd know  you'd be the first to know  number one  you wouldn't be here  you wouldn't be here  we haven't had an empty seat in any event  i don't believe  that we've ever been to  i don't think we've ever had窶ｦ we always have people  we haven't had an empty seat  you look anywhere  north carolina  ohio  no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people  we put screens outside  i know tonight's not so good  we got a hundred degrees out  but you still have thousands of people out there  we could have sold this arena out  you know that  we could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times  can you believe that  10 times  i think that's like a poll  that's like a poll because when biden goes out i see sleepy joe and he says  ""they had 115 people show up  115 people  that's our first row "" the democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction  the last administration said a lie  if you like your plan  you can keep your plan  if you like your doctor  you can keep your doctor  28 times  a total lie  my administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want  and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than obamacare  and a lot of people are starting to figure that out  better healthcare  and we'll also always protect窶ｦ you have to remember this  you ready  because they give us a bum rap  patients with preexisting conditions are protected by republicans much more so than protected by democrats who will never be able to pull it off  preexisting conditions  and you know  the job we've done on healthcare  it's not talked about  but we're also doing something  it's been phenomenal  we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans  and you know what  they're going to be taken away  under the democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines  all of the things they did  they went out  negotiated great private plans  it's all going to be taken away from you under this plan  now  i only hope they don't change because we're talking too soon  we got a year and a half left  it's like when i called pocahontas  pocahontas  i should've waited six months because she then went out and got that test  1024th  and i've always said i have more indian blood in me than she has in her  and i have none  i have none  but it's more than she has  1024  i brought it up too soon so i don't talk about it anymore  but if she should be the candidate  which i tend to doubt  but if she should be we'll bring it up again and i think it will be very successful  1024  how about this  i was driving her crazy  so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood  i'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that  he checked her blood and found out that many  many  many  many  many  many years ago  there could have been somebody and he could have been indian  and then the indians got together and they said  ""we don't want her "" we want trump  we want trump  they want trump  we've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic  what a problem  and just today it was just announced before i came in  that drug overdose deaths窶ｦ we're working so hard on this  including our vice president  including our first lady  including everybody in the trump administration  it's dropped for the first time in more than 30 years  it's gone down  first time  it was a big problem  and in north carolina and we're far from finished  it's a big problem  it declined 8% last year  that's a lot because it was just going up like a rocket  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth  well then you have the gentleman from窶ｦ our governor from virginia  so we're talking about late term  he's talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision  that's the first i've heard of it  that's the first most of you have heard of it  and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay  this is a baby that's born  this isn't late term  this is a baby that's born  nobody's ever heard anything like that  nobody's ever seen anything like it  nobody's ever seen anything like it  and that actually  when he had the scandal  that became  can you believe it  the second biggest story  can you believe that  how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story  and what a shame when that's the second biggest story  what happened to our values  republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of god  that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion intolerance and division  the republican party is the party for all americans and american values  we are the party of the american worker  the american family  and we are the party of the american dream  this is the proud banner the republican party will carry into the republican national convention next summer in the great city of charlotte  north carolina  don't disappoint me  that should be good for at least 10 points  right  these are some of the greatest ladies  i see them in ohio  and florida  we love you too  thank you  really  how many have you been to  just out of curiosity  what's the number  all but two  i've done hundreds of them  and then they say women don't like trump  i think they do  now i see them  they're great  great ladies  you're great  it's interesting with women  so women want to have a strong military protection  they want to have strong borders  they want to have strong law enforcement  they want to have great education  they want to have low taxes for their family  not high taxes  they want to have all the things that we talk about  why wouldn't they want trump more than anybody else  the other side is going to go the opposite  and they did in the last election  and we're doing a lot better  the difference is  the last election i was a successful businessman running for president  i said i was going to do things  and by the way  really successful  i'm going to show you something someday soon  i'm going to show you something  they say he was really successful  he wasn't successful  he's really smart  or he's really stupid but he's trying to take over the world  they have so many messages  he's really stupid  then next week  donald trump has a sinister plot to take over the world  he can't be too stupid  because they actually think it's working  i saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and he's a pretty respected comedian  he said  he's not leaving  i'm telling you  he's not leaving  he'll never live  he'll win this election and in 24窶ｲ  i'm telling you  he's not leaving  he's going to stay  so we did through our friend dan scavino  we did a time magazine cover  i was on so many times  i don't even read this thing  and it says  trump  2014  2018  but it says 20 here's where we go  we start at 16  we go to 20  we go to 24  did you see it  then it says 28  32  36  40  42  no  we don't need any more time  we don't need any more time  we need one more  a senator came to my office  sir  i'm six foot seven  i'm great  i'm six foot seven so i can give you great advice  i said  ""senator  i'm one for one but it happened to be the president "" and now i want to be two for two  two for two  two for two  so we have 16  we have 20  we have 24  and you know what's very interesting though  they were really people out there think i'm not leaving  can you believe it  hey  maybe that is a good idea  let's think about it  watch  you want to drive them crazy  they're going to go crazy  all i have to do is say  ""let's think about it  they're going to go crazy  no  i promise 2024  i leave  by that time  just so you know  by that time our country will be so well seated  it will be so strong like never  ever  in our history  but everything that we built  low taxes  strong military  taking care of our vets  all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now  i've always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country  a lot of people felt that  so i don't know  i can't say this is more important  what we did was a miracle  not to us it wasn't  but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had  there's never been anything like it  never been such excitement  never been such excitement  but you know what  if we don't win in 2020 everything that we've done  seriously though  everything that we've done  your 401's are going to crash  the whole thing  it's going to come down like a stack of cards  so  in a certain way  let's say this is of equal importance  by that time we'll have values instilled  we'll have free enterprise instilled  people are working now  we have the lowest food stamps that we've had in many years  lowest food stamps because people are working  so i really think it's at least equal  it's equal  maybe it's a little less  who the hell knows  i just know this  it can disappear very  very quickly  we have to get out  we have to vote  that's why i'm starting early  can you believe it  we have less窶ｦ i see all these clowns on television i say i guess we have to counteract them a little bit  but this is not what you want running  none of them  this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours  every day we make good on the motto  promises made  promises kept  i've had people back there that don't like me and somebody said  very nicely  that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made  it's true  i've done things that i never窶ｦ i never said we were going to get  as an example with our vets  that we going to get  joyce  that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly  we can fire them now  they've been trying to get that for 44 years  joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning  joyce's so simple and yet they never got it  nobody got it through  we're good at getting things through  we've done more than we said we would  a man i know  who i don't like  a businessman  very  very  very successful  one of the most successful but i don't like him  never liked him  he never liked me  by the way  in fact  i would go a step further  he cannot stand me  and i saw him about two months ago and he came up to me  i said  ""how are you doing "" very warm  hey  how you doing  let's get out of here  and he said  ""i'm doing good  you're doing good "" i said  ""yeah "" i said  ""you don't like me  and i don't like you  i never have liked you  and you never have liked me  but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy  and if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it "" and he said to me  ""mr  president "" he calls me mr  president  everybody calls me mr  president  it's true  it's a funny thing  he said  ""mr  president  you're right  i'm supporting you  i think you're doing a great job  and maybe we didn't get along "" but it's not like he has a choice  he has no choice  and on top of that  it's a good choice because we've done the right thing  and it is funny with the name mr  president  i have friends  really good friends  and they've always called me don  donald  d  they call me anything  and you lose all your friends when you're president because they're all afraid to talk to you  does that make sense  no  it's true  except for these six  seven  ladies up here  they always talk  they're not intimidated  no  it's true  i have guys  i have wonderful friends  new york developers  tough guys  smart guys  they're rich  they're this  that  i have middle of the road  i have poor  i have everybody  i have poor guys  middle of the road  and rich guys  doesn't matter  rich guys call up  ""mr  president  how are you sir  it's richard "" oh  good  rich  hey richard  loosen up  this is a guy who used to  ""hey don  how you doing  let's go to dinner "" now you're  ""sir  is everything窶ｦ you're doing good  sir "" i said  ""richard  call me donald like you always did  call me donald  always call me donald "" okay  thank you donald  thank you very much  and then two minutes later  mr president  it's been so great to窶ｦ i lost all my friends  they've tightened up  they've choked  you know what that is  they choked  they can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency  they have respect for the office of the president  they have respect for our country again  our country is respected again  we've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written  including two supreme court justices  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  we've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs  and last year  i'm so proud of this because we have no help from the democrats  last year  for the first time in over 50 years  drug prices went down  and that was for a reason  to give former prisoners a second chance at life  we passed groundbreaking  criminal justice reform  it's a big thing  prisoners they've gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this  we did a lot of things  because they get out jail they don't have a chance  they always go back  most of the time  now they're coming out and we have programs  but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners  and you have to see the reviews they're getting  they getting phenomenal reviews  it's a beautiful thing  it's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners  they get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening and we're very proud of them  we're expanding opportunities zone so that no american is left behind  it's one of the great successes the opportunity zones  nobody talks about it  it's one of the great successes  and thanks to our pledge to america's workers  private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million americans  isn't that nice  whenever i hear that word apprentice  i say i love that word  that was a good show  they figured  you know what we'll do  we'll get arnold schwarzenegger to take my place  that didn't work out too well  that didn't work out too well  we had 14 seasons  think of that  the apprentice  i've proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing  400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking  and we have secured  soon to be three years  record funding for our military  we want to cut budgets  but this is beyond budget  i withdrew the united states from the horrible  one-sided  disgusting iran nuclear deal  and iran is a different country today than it was  my administration proudly recognized the true capitol of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  that was some day  they all said  ""many  many presidents have said  ""we're going to do it "" then they never did "" i know why  because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it  and then on top of it  a couple of months ago  i just approved the golan heights for israel  the golan heights  another thing  52 years they tried to do that  they didn't get it done  so we're doing good  we also recognize the legitimate government of venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries  tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country  will never  ever  be a socialist country  it just won't happen  a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream  frankly  the destruction of our country  that's what's going to happen  take a look around  their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders  but refuses to protect our own borders  think of it  they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks  they're coming back home a lot  we defeated isis  the caliphate in syria  we're bringing our soldiers back home  isis does not like me too much  but i came here and it was a mess  it was a mess  i met with generals  general believe it or not  one general  his name is raisin  i said  ""what's your name "" sir  this guy's like out of a movie  watch  he's going to be famous after this but who cares  what's your name  and he goes  ""sir  my name is raisin "" i said  ""raisin  like you mean a little raisin ""  yes sir  it's my name  that's what they call me  what's your last name  kane  i said  ""you mean your name is raisin kane "" i said  raisin kane  you're my kind of general  let me talk to you raisin kane  get over here "" and my previous general said  ""it's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate "" i said  did raisin kane and a couple of other generals that were there  these guys are central casting like from a movie  except better  they're stronger  bigger  tougher  meaner  and actually better looking in a certain way  but they're like from a movie  there is nobody in hollywood plays a role like this  i said  ""generals  i've been told it's going take a year  two years  to get a 100% "" remember i want to pull them out  we're down to 1%  and everyone went crazy  explain that one  but they said it was going to take a long time  i said to raisin kane and the other generals  ""general  how long can it take  they said  ""sir  one month "" i said  ""what "" we're going to hit them from the front  we're going to hit them from the back  we're going to hit them from the  sir  we're going to hit them like they never got hit before  we were never allowed to do this  and we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in syria  sir  we're going to hit him from iraq  we're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed  sir  they'll be hit so goddamn hard sir  they will be窶ｦ thank you very much  very shortly  very  very shortly  it was over  we had a 100% of the caliphate  and these people we're screwing around for years  obama  president obama  my generals did a great job  i flew there  i flew to iraq  remember  i'm an air force one and they notified me  ""sir  we're 45 minutes out  sir  we have to close all windows  we have to turn off all lights in the plane  sir  all windows  all lights have to be off  sir  we're turning off the lights outside and the runway light  sir  they going to be in a very dim""窶ｦ frankly  if you're not at 30-year old pilot you can't see them  because i went there  i said  ""i don't see any light pilot "" as we're landing  i said  ""i don't see "" and then i thought to myself  think of it  we've spent almost  8 trillion in the middle east and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land  how bad is that  they didn't do their job  we did our job  and the military did their job  but we fight to short of just keep going  we don't fight to win  i fight to win  i fight to win  so we land in this big  beautiful air force one and i'm saying  ""major  i don't see a runway "" yes sir  it's right up ahead  the guy's 30 years old or something  they'll get me that  they'll say majors aren't 30  maybe he's 35 whatever he is  they're saying  ""yes sir  it's right there "" i don't see it major  how about lifting up  let's go around  that's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world  he said  ""sir  it's right there  sir "" and we're landing and i still haven't seen a light  but these guys  we have the greatest pilots in the world  we have the greatest military in the world  we have the greatest equipment in the world  so you must never forget the 2020 election is all about one thing  you  it's about you  it's about your family  it's about your future  and the fate of your beautiful  loving  country  and that's what it is  we begin our north carolina campaign with the best record  the best results  the best agenda  and the only positive vision for our nation's future  we love our nation  our nation is great today  it's going to be much greater  every year it's getting better  and better  we have turned this big  beautiful  mighty ship  we have turned it around  it's getting better  better  better  together we will continue on unleashing the power of american enterprise so every american can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck positive vision for our nation's future  we love our nation  our nation is great today  it's going to be much greater  every year it's getting better  and better  we have turned this big  beautiful  mighty ship  we have turned it around  it's getting better  better  better  together we will continue unleashing the power of american enterprise so every american can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck  with your help  we will elect a republican congress  those great gentlemen that just left the stage  to create a safe  modern  fair and lawful system of immigration  we will enact trade deals and they are going like you won't even believe  that doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me  there was a recent poll  germany likes obama better than trump  a lot better  i said  ""of course  because i'm making them pay their bills "" i'm saying you got to pay  i say  ""anguilla  anguilla  you got to pay  anguilla "" obama would go in  make a speech  leave  i go in and make a speech  i say  let me speak to anguilla  anguilla you got to pay your bills  you're way behind "" so i would think that they should  they should all like窶ｦ when you hear they like me better  i'm not doing my job  it's true  i'm not doing my job  they did a poll on one of these networks  and they would say  ""donald trump is not liked in europe nearly as much as president obama "" i said  ""or president bush  or anybody "" in fact i'm disliked  but actually they respect us  that's more important  look at that beautiful baby  look at that beautiful baby  wow  what a baby  what a baby  that is a beautiful baby  that's like from an advertisement  perfect  look how happy that baby is  so beautiful  thank you darling  that's really nice  it's a great thing  is that your husband  that's a great thing  thank you

proudly stamped with those four beautiful words  made in america  made in the usa  either one is okay with me  keep america great  that's right  we will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing government schools  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  they're going to take your guns away  above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation  as one america  it's one america  we believe in the american constitution and we believe in the rule of law  we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy  are the true american way  we believe that children  like your child  should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto  ""in god we trust "" we are fighting for every american mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious children  we have been blessed with the greatest republic on the face of the earth  but it was going in the wrong direction  and now we are turning it around  it is going better than ever before and we going to keep it that way  we're going to keep it that way  with your help  with your devotion  with your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  we are one movement  one movement  think of that  we are one big beautiful movement  there has

now than it was three years ago  this is the strongest movement in the history of our country  but we are  we're one movement  we're one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  we're doing things that nobody thought was possible  no other nation thought it was possible what we're doing  we are so respected  you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world  so respected  because together  we will make america wealthy again  of course  we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market  so pretty soon  and i hate to say  i don't want to ruin the rhetorical skill  but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete  we will make our nation wealthy again  the fact is we have the strongest stock market in our history  so i think i'll have to change it  you've all heard it many times  right  we will make america wealthy again  we're going to have to say  ""we have made america wealthy again "" so here's one  we will make america strong again  no  no  we're going to have to change this  we have made america strong again  and just so you know  we have made america great again  give up maga  how do you give

say that 窶ｦ look at all that news back there  look at all that fake news  when i say that  their heads explode  our movement is pro-jobs  pro-worker  pro-police  and 100% pro-american  as we begin tonight  our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in los angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range  tonight  we send our love and our support to their families  and we pray to god for their recovery  the radical left in america is waging open war on law enforcement  hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs  you see it  you see it all the time  please  sit down  please  let's have a little fun  we got plenty of time  i mean  here it is  i mean  what do we have  football is boring as hell  it's just not the same  right  i don't know  used to be people would say  ""hey  could you keep it away from a football game "" now they're saying  ""could you possibly do it during the football game "" we have some free time  but during violent demonstrations in las vegas  a 29-year-old police officer  you know this very well  was deliberately shot in the head  leaving the young  brave officer paralyzed  yet  sleepy joe biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police  they're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way  at his convention  he never even mentioned the words  ""law and order""  never mentioned them once  now  he's all of a sudden  his polls are dropping like a rock  and he's starting to say  ""but we need law and order "" and then he goes back into the basement for four days  what happens to this guy  i know what happens to him  he's shot  that's what happened to him  every once in a while  the great dana white 窶ｦ does anybody know dana white  he's got some champions with him tonight  he's here  i got to introduce him  but every once in a while  i'll ask him  ""what happened to that guy "" he said  ""sir  he's been shot for the last 窶ｦ long time "" should have left a long time ago  that's joe biden  joe biden  he's shot  and everybody knows it  and you know what  they ought to be ashamed  because they do interviews with him  they give him the questions  and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter  and that's the fake news  it is  how about the other day  could you move that a little bit closer  see these things  move it a little bit  i must tell you at great peril  i used them seldom  but those are the times we have the best fun too  i will say  and that's actually when we learn the most  for the entire summer  biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers  when biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations  court houses  joe biden called them peaceful protestors  right  they call them peaceful protestors  and when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems  because everyone 窶ｦ look at the top-10  you go back 窶ｦ go top-20  top-30  take a look  democrat-run  radical left-wing  democrat  usually run  not republican-run  democrat-run  and we go back  and we take a look  we want to give them help  they don't want help  but when they do ask for help  and when they do  we go in  like minneapolis  the national guard went in  took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks  they knew we were going in to seattle  we told them  ""we're going in tomorrow morning "" and so  they sent them in  they didn't want that to happen  and we let the protestors know  or whatever you call them  they're really anarchists  they're not protestors  so we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10 000 very tough people  and they immediately raised their hands  and the seattle police  who by the way  could do a great job if they were let to do their job  but they're not  they're not  and as you know  in portland  the other day  we had to send in the us marshalls  a man  who's a bad guy  bad guy  shot somebody right in the middle of the street  who they say was a very fine young man  shot him  killed him  just shot him like 窶ｦ it was on television  two-and-a-half days  nothing happened  i said  ""what's going on "" we sent in the us marshalls  it was taken care of in 15 minutes  okay  15 minutes  when asked if he would cut police funding  sleepy joe said  ""absolutely  yes  i would "" now he's trying to change his mind  you ever see a guy 窶ｦ he changed his mind on fracking  okay  ""there will be no fracking "" you know that  he went all throughout the debates  he doesn't even know what fracking is  i guarantee you  he was told to say that by bernie and the radical left and his vice president  by the way  how bad is she  she is the worst  we're going to have a woman president some day  not going to be her  not going to be her  and that's no way to attain the office  we got in there because sleepy joe couldn't handle it anymore  joe is bad primetime  see  the reason i can talk so badly about him  because he did an ad  where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago  and they said 窶ｦ and nobody loves the military more  look what i've done for them   2 5 trillion  and in the ad  they have me saying horrible things in front of other people  nobody would have put up with that  it's called disinformation  they make up a total lie  they put it out  then they do ads  so once he did that  i said  ""now  really  look  it's okay  it's okay  because now the gloves are off "" i can say that this man is totally unfit to be president  up here  he's totally unfit  he can't be your president  i've gotten to know president xi of china  i've gotten to know president putin of russia  and by the way  getting along with them is good  although china  i must tell you  got a real problem with china  what they did with us  we can never forget that  we made a great trade deal  the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in from china  they stopped it from going into china  but they didn't stop it from going into our country  europe and the rest of the world  okay  they could have done that  but you see  i deal with all of these people  and they don't have the kind of mental problem that sleepy joe has  they're very sharp  kim jong-un  kim jong-un doesn't know about the problems that joe has  we need very sharp people  i'm sorry  joe is not qualified for this position  joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons  he wants to close prisons  and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently  you saw that  the enemy  until his polls started dropping  then all of a sudden  he said  ""no  we love law enforcement "" i think i've gotten every major law enforcement group in the country  right  you saw recently  i got new york's finest  and they are new york's finest  but they're not allowed to do their job  they're not allowed  we have a radical left mayor who has no clue  he has no clue what's happening to that poor city  i love that city  what's happening to that city  300% up  look  300% in certain very bad crimes  new york  there's no reason for this  and we have the greatest police  they're great  new york's finest  they endorsed me  chicago  fraternal order of police  chicago endorsed me  oklahoma endorsed me  texas endorsed me  florida endorsed me  every place endorsed me  and if you think it's easy for new york and chicago and these different places 窶ｦ ohio endorsed me  if you think it's easy for these guys  they never endorse  new york  they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate  they endorsed me  and they're against their radical left culture that's destroying the city  so i was very honored  but how about chicago  do you think it's easy for these great police in chicago to endorse me  it's not easy  but they felt that they had an obligation to do it  so it just happened  i'm just very honored by it  and biden's anti-police crusade must stop  it's got to stop  it's got to stop now  furthermore  the corporations  these poor  stupid people that run the 窶ｦ they got paid a lot of money  they're weak  ineffective people  let's face it  they're funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are 窶ｦ it's so embarrassing  and i don't mean for a little  they gave  100 million and 250 窶ｦ you're talking about serious money  you're talking about serious money  and that money is not used for good reasons  and these stupid corporations 窶ｦ and they'll be the first to go if the radical left ever took 窶ｦ they'd throw those guys out like they were nothing  if they were lucky  they'd just be thrown out  it would probably be a lot rougher than that  these people don't know what they're getting into  but instead of giving money  they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers  that's what they should do  so in the republican party  we know that police officers are not villains  but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe  and they guard 窶ｦ the thing that's incredible 窶ｦ i know so many police  they're so good  one bad apple  and they're on for months  one bad apple  they go on for months  the thousands and tens of thousands of good things  nobody talks about it  these are great people that have done a great job  and we have to support our law enforcement  so biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists  and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists  okay  and we also believe that if you murder a police officer  you should receive the death penalty  and that's something that's very important fine people  i mean  they're in very grave condition  as you know  fine people  he's an animal  and i called him an animal  and i was criticized by people  calling him an animal  they said he's a human being  he's not a human being  he's an animal  he's not a human being  joe biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who 窶ｦ i mean  look  you have to see  even for these cop killers who go around  the predators  they murder children  people like the boston bomber  he opposes the death penalty for the boston bomber  he wants to give prisoners a vote  he wants to have the boston bomber be able to vote  i don't think so  i don't think so  i don't think so  you know who's thought of that  bernie sanders  crazy bernie  he wants to have 窶ｦ crazy bernie  he says  ""no  no  they have to vote "" so they asked him  ""well  does that mean every 窶ｦ "" that means everybody that's in prisons should be entitled to a vote  right  so they actually said  ""well  what about the boston bomber  should he entitled "" and bernie goes  ""yeah  he should be entitled "" bernie is crazy  but the fact is  that we got a lot of bernie votes four years ago  because bernie's right about one thing  trade  because all of these countries  friend and foe  they ripoff the united states  we have made so many great trade deals  and you see it  usmca  we got rid of nafta  so many  but biden is too weak to be president  and he's not a smart person  and by the way  he wasn't smart 25 years ago  everybody knew it  now we don't even have to discuss the matter  but i was going to say  when he put that ad up  we told him to take it down  when he put that ad up  that dishonored our fallen heroes  they are great  great heroes of mine  of yours  of everybody's  i know really bad people  no bad person  the worst person i know  i know some beauties from new york  i know some developers in new york actually  nobody would say what they said  they made it up  it was a made up statement  and they put it up in the form an ad  from a third-rate magazine  who's best friend is obama  who  by the way  got caught spying on my campaign  he got caught  we caught him cold  we have him cold  now let's see what happens  now the republicans  it's interesting  we have much better policy  but the republicans  they don't fight like colby  you know who colby is  you're going to say hello to colby  they don't fight like colby  they don't fight to win  better policy  but they don't have that vicious streak  if this were reversed  they would be in jail for two years already  and it would be for a 50-year term for treason  that's what it would be  okay  but biden's too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will  he'll never have the strength  and he's going downhill fast  it's going to be very interesting  and i called for a drug test  because you know what  i want a drug test  because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy  i watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics  and he was so bad  no  he was so bad  maybe he'll win because they don't like me  they don't like my personality  but i hate to say it  i'm what you need  i'm what you need  we love you  we love you  we love you  we love you  we love you  we love you  we love you  but if biden ever did win  he would surrender your country to the mob  you know that  and he will have nothing to do with it  it's not him  i mean  he's being 窶ｦ he's going to be pushed around  and she's  by the way  just so you know what you're going to get  she's considered far more liberal than bernie sanders  how about that  that's what you're going to have  i don't think your state is into that  unlike biden  i'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement  and i'm deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements  that to me is a really big deal  that to me is really a big deal  and i just want to thank all of them  including the national troopers association and coalition just came in  we also received the endorsement  total and complete endorsement from the public safety alliance of nevada  and the las vegas police protective association from nevada  and i want to thank for that  steve grammar  who's with us tonight  where's steve  was steve here  steve  thank you  thank you  that's a big deal  make sure they get out and vote  steve  because they're playing around with the ballots  okay  you know your governor  so we had many sites  by the way  all exterior sites  all outside  today  you'll hear these phoneys back there  well  look at that  now today you're going to hear them  they'll say  ""oh  it was in 窶ｦ"" well  the reason it was  we had five sites  all outside sites  like last night  tremendous room  and a great gentleman who owns this building said  ""you know what  what they're doing is really unfair  you can use my building  don  i want to thank you  don "" i want to thank you  this is the most important election in the history of our country  at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties  two visions  two philosophies  two agendas for the future  joe biden has spent the last 47 years selling out america  look at what he's done  everything he's done was wrong  he always voted the wrong way  even his secretary of defense  his secretary of state  they said he always voted the wrong way  he was off shoring your jobs  throwing open your borders  depleting our military  and sacrificing your children's future to china and other faraway lands  i've spent the last four 窶ｦ he says 窶ｦ only in nevada can you have 窶ｦ i would never say it  what did you say  okay  this way i can't get in trouble  i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america  securing our borders  rebuilding our military  and standing up to china like no other president has ever done  if biden wins  china wins  if biden wins  the mob wins  if biden wins the rioters and anarchists  and 窶ｦ look  you see what's going on  the arsonists and flag burners  how about the flag burning  i would love- i would love to have a law 窶ｦ this is so sad what's going on  when i see the american flag burn  i get so angry  i get so angry  i would love to have a law  it has to go through a big process  you burn the flag  you go to jail for one year  i would love to see it  i would love to see it  i would love to see it  i would love to see it  if i were a congressman or senator  i'd be in there with that one  you know  they'll say  ""oh  freedom of speech "" that's not freedom of speech  you burn the flag  you should go to jail for one year  i really mean that  they'll say  ""oh  it's horrible  he's against free speech "" no  no  we're not  we're not against free speech  but i'm running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in  and it's happening very fast  and i'm running for your state  i love this state  you know  i put a lot of money in this state and it's been a great investment  and we want to keep this state strong  not for that reason  by the way  for other reasons  because this is a great place  you have a governor right now who's a political hack  we want to put violent criminals behind bars  and tell you governor to open up your state  by the way  open up your state  you know  just so you know  these shutdowns  we did the right thing  we had the greatest economy in the history of the world  they came in  they 窶ｦ we were all seeing what was happening  we closed up  i mean  you know  you're presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say  ""sir  we have to close it "" and we did the right thing  we closed it  well  actually he didn't think we should close it yet  but later on  he said  ""we did the right thing "" we closed it  we closed it  we saved millions of lives  if we wouldn't have closed it  we would've been talking two and a half or three million  we're at 180  it's far too much  but we would have been talking about 窶ｦ it would've been unacceptable  unsustainable  it would've been so bad  think of it  we're at 180 000  other countries are doing terribly  did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries  us compared to europe  we have done an incredible job  we get absolutely no credit for the job we've done  and i don't want it myself  but i want it for the admirals and the generals and mike pence  and joe biden was against it  remember  he was totally against closing  he said  ""oh  he's xenophobic "" i'm xenophobic  i wanted it closed and nobody else did  at that time  nobody else did  i was way early  you know  they say  ""he didn't act fast "" i was months early  nancy pelosi was a month and a half later saying  ""come to chinatown  let's come to chinatown "" and sleepy joe was totally 窶ｦ he thought what i was doing was terrible  then all of a sudden  now i see him saying  ""he should have closed it earlier "" this guy 窶ｦ you know  the great thing about the age in which we live  it's all down in tape  it's all down  i got a reel on him  we call it biden's best  you got to hear this  but we want to ensure the future of america  not the future of china and other countries  because if we win  america wins  and it's all about america first  you've had presidents  they never put america first  they didn't put america first  they didn't take care of our country  but we're taking care of our country  now  joe biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn't believe  truly  in our country  but i think that's a very strong statement  i don't think he has a clue  i'll be honest  the people that push him around don't believe in our country  because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy bernie  right  it's called the manifesto  you know why it's called the manifesto  because this is beyond socialism  this is a word that starts with a c  not and s  that's where they're coming from  that's where they're coming from  at biden's convention they decried america wicked  and they were saying it's wicked sinful  it's destined for a fate of doom and despair  that was  by the way  that was the most depressing convention  we had a great convention  we had a great convention  they actually said that america wasn't great  they actually said that america was never great  you know who said that  cuomo  the governor of new york  said america wasn't great  i don't know if he's going to get away with that one  that's going to haunt him  that's going to haunt him  america wasn't great  him and his brother  fredo  you ever watch fredo  his ratings aren't very good  so you probably don't  but we know the truth  america's the most exceptional nation on earth  and our destiny is blessed by god  we love this nation with all of our heart and soul  and we will always take care of our nation  you know  we have a little expression  ""make america great again "" that's what's happened  and you know  we had it done  now i say  ""make america great again  again "" comma  i go comma again  and that's what we're doing at a record clip  they've never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else  you see the numbers  on november 3rd  nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity  and we're doing it  we're going to have a tremendous year next year  or whether we'll allow joe biden and the group of handlers to impose a  4 trillion tax hike  ban american energy  destroy our suburbs  demolish our second amendment  and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-american lie  yeah  get him out of here  would you please  under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world  he's going home to mom  and now we're doing it again  we're developing a vaccine in record time  the other administration would have been years  and we're almost there  it's going to be announced very soon  we'll be ready before the end of the year  and we will very easily defeat the china virus  that's what's happening  and we're already making that turn  we're making that round beautiful last turn  but it should have never happened  china should have never let that happen  they should have stopped it in china  under my administration  before the virus  we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in nevada's history  and we'll soon be there again  you see what's happening  a guy like biden would totally eradicate nevada's economy  he would make it impossible for you to compete  and he's already said if the doctor suggested  he would shut down the country again  we're not shutting down our country  a shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of american  look the americans  you know  on the other side if you look at these shutdowns  and you're living through it right now  you know  there aren't many states that are shut down  they're all democrats  north carolina  your state  but north carolina  we're not 窶ｦ you take a look at north carolina  pennsylvania shut down  every one of them that are shut down are doing not well  they're not doing well  and they all have democrat governors  and you know  when you look at the suicide rates  when you look at all of the suicide  all of the domestic violence  the drugs  all of the problems  we can't have it  we can't have it  open up your state  you got to open up your state  it's all political  it's all political  it's all political  on november 4th  they'll announce  ""we're going to open up the states "" they're only doing it to affect your november 3rd great election  most important election  biden will always do whatever the radical left demands  and if elected  his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets  they'll be running the department of justice  the department of homeland security  and by the way  the united states supreme court  and we will have a very different country  you know  the next president probably will have anywhere one  two  three  or four supreme court justices  if you want your second amendment  if you want life  if you want so many other things  even having to do with your military  even having to do with your vets  if you want things  if you want  you've got to have the court  because they'll last for 25  30  40 years  they're put on as young people and they stay a long time  our country will never be the same  we'll never be able to recover from it  so you got to get out on november 3rd or early voting  you got to get out and vote  and you could send your ballot  and then you have to check that your ballot's counted because they might not count your ballot in this state  they may not count your ballot  but we're looking to save and we're going to save america  we're not going to let that happen  so we're joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they've done  you see it  i mean  you've seen it all the way  the job they've done in their campaign  they beat people that were very good  very talented  great politicians  and they won  dan  where is he  dan rodimer  dan rodimer  dan rodimer  and we're with you all the way  dan  and jim marchant  jim  thank you very much  thank you  jim  so we're backing you all the way  you got to get them in  we will take back the house  you know why  because people cannot stand nancy pelosi  they don't like nancy pelosi  even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in  can you believe that  nancy pelosi's a customer  she turned her in  she thought it was disgraceful  but that's what we're dealing with  a bunch of phonies  but you guys  we have your back 100%  michael  you'll make sure  all right  i also want to introduce and thank 窶ｦ he's done a fantastic job  nevada republican party chairman  michael mcdonald  and a friend of mine  and thank you  michael  your former attorney general adam laxalt  and a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly  she's tough  but she's very kind  she's a great person  kimberly guilfoyle  thank you  kimberly  thank you  thank you  kimberly  the owner of the chicago cubs and he's in first place  so he's very happy  the rnc finance chairman  todd ricketts  where is todd  todd  thank you  great  go win that pennant todd  win the pennant  one of the best people ever to work for me 窶ｦ one of the best people ever to work for me in government  he's tough  he's smart  he can be vicious  but he's just fair more than anything else  but he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power  rick grenell  thank you  rick  thank you don  thank you don  also  a las vegas legend  rick harrison  rick  thank you rick  you are a legend  aren't you  huh  great job you've done  great job you've done  a friend of mine for a long time  years ago  he was looking for a place  can i tell this story just quickly  do you mind  he was looking for a place and they said  ""well  that sport's never going to make it  it's too violent "" they just don't know how violent the american people are  do they  they never quite figured that out  ""no "" they said  ""no  it'll never make it "" there's nobody like this guy  i'm telling you  i always say it's a great sport  without him  i don't know what they'd do  i don't know if anything would make it窶ｦ he could do anything  he is so smart  so tough  so cunning  he's been a friend of mine for a long time  i've been a friend of his  but i gave him a place a long time ago  and all i know is  just like we have outside  we had lines  i said  ""what the hell is going on here  dana  this place is packed  we were packed  we had thousands of people that couldn't get in  and i was so nice  i said  ""let's do it again  dana  please "" and we did it again and again and again  and it became the ufc and he sold it and has a big chunk of it  but he got  4 billion when he sold it   4 billion  that's not too bad  that's not too bad  dana  but he really is  he's an incredible guy  and he also loves his fighters  he wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along  the best  but i want to introduce dana white  dana  please stand up  and dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with  because under those beautiful suits  there are a lot of muscles  a lot of power  a lot of genius for fighting and for other things  but a lot of genius under those suits  a few members of the ufc community  here's a man  he used to walk into that ring and he still does  and he's as good as there is in the world  number one in the world  you don't want to pick a fight with him at a bar  let's say you'd had a fight and you happen to meet colby covington  you say  ""what's your name "" and he said  ""my name's colby covington "" and the first time i saw colby covington  he walks into the ring  now he wasn't fighting  but he walked in with that same hat that you're wearing  it said  ""keep america great "" it says  make窶ｦ"" he doesn't care  as long as it has trump on in someplace  he doesn't care  he doesn't discriminate  but this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy  who's now in big trouble for doing what he did  and then he walks in wearing the hat  ""keep america great "" and he wears the hat and he's going like this because this was a big story  you remember what they did to that guy  conservative reporter  not a fighter  he wasn't a fighter  and it was 10 people against one  now  if we had 10 people against that one  those 10 people would be in serious trouble  they said  ""what the hell "" but i'd like to introduce colby covington  great fighter  great  great fighter  incredible  he is a great fighter  three months ago  i saw him fight a guy  he looked like it would be impossible to beat  i never saw muscles  he had muscles on muscles on muscles  and colby is a very fit guy and fantastic  but he didn't look quite the same  it wasn't even a contest  it went a few rounds  i couldn't believe what you did  he took him apart so easily  it was like an easy day at the office  so you have to explain that to me someday  colby  but we love you  man  you're with us and where we are with you  another great  great champion  another great champion  henry cejudo  one of the best in the world  and henry  please stand  please  now  you won the championship twice  right henry  twice  he won it twice  don't

like our dana  thank you dana  very much  great honor  thank you  man  tonight  we're also praying for everyone throughout the west affected by the devastating wildfires  we want really forest management  we want forest management窶ｦ my administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders  with the governor and we thank the more than 28 000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life  and i'm going there tomorrow  i'll be going to california tomorrow  we have meetings with fema and all of the different people  it'll be amazing to see  it's like the biggest we've ever had  it's crazy  it's crazy what's going on  thousands and thousands and thousands of acres  it's crazy  so we're going to be there tomorrow  we'll be with the governor  we're also going to various other places  washington also is in big trouble and oregon  i spoke with the governor of oregon and they've never had anything like it  and of course they also have a place called portland and we will put that fire out  just tell us to put it out  governor  that fire we'll put out  that's a much easier fire to put out  it would take us less than a half an hour  we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by joe biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period  we passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts  we achieved american energy independence  nobody thought it was possible  when biden pledged to abolish the production of american oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas  which is very clean  and he wanted to ban fracking  we said  ""no  we're not doing that  for 47 years  biden crushed the dreams of american workers to enrich foreign countries  that's what happened  look  he says he's going to change  he's been there for 47 years and you know that he's been there until three and a half years ago  so it's not like  ""gee  he hasn't done it for 20 "" he was there recently  they didn't do it  and you don't change  and you always go back to the first statement  his first statement was anti- religion  his first statement was anti-fracking  anti-energy  his first statement was anti all of the things  but it was really anti-gun  anti-second amendment  he even put this whack job  he even put beto o'rourke  beto  great deal for us  that's a great deal  by the way  our stock market is setting records  i hate to say  in the middle a pandemic  but hopefully  as we round that final turn on the pandemic  we're setting records with the stock market  your 401k's are doing very well  your stocks are doing very well  and you know what  if something would happen where he'd get in  and there's a headwind  believe it or not  that stock market would be much higher  but there's a headwind on the possibility  okay  everything is a possibility  there's a headwind  but i'll tell you what  if he ever got in  you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before  just remember it  just to remember it  because what they want to do is crazy  the green new deal   100 trillion  the green new deal  that's more money than we could make in a thousand years  a hundred trillion dollars  ""we don't like that building  the windows are too big "" what do you do  ""rip it down and build a new one "" ""all good  that sounds good "" i saved the u s  auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe  the trans-pacific partnership  and we're building many auto plants  you know that  some here  but we're building many auto plants in michigan  many auto plants in michigan  if we don't win michigan after all those auto plants  and i don't know  but it's been tough but we won it last time  and we're showing a poll that just came out that we're two points up in michigan  that's very good  that's very good  i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rapid theft of american jobs  biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in the usa  that's what it is  for the last four years  i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic community  i'm fighting for school choice  safe neighborhoods  low taxes  low regulations on all hispanic-owned small business  and they are great business people  and they understood that  they understood that  they understood it窶ｦ and by the way  there's nobody that knows our southern border better than  i call them the hispanics  i call them the latino  i said  ""what do you prefer "" it's very interesting  some say  ""call us latino "" others say  ""call us hispanic "" others say  ""call us whatever the hell you want  we love you  we love you "" but our hispanic population knows our southern border better than anybody else  and they don't want criminals coming across  they want people to come across  but they want them to come across legally  and we have the strongest southern border now that we've ever had  the democrats and biden would be a disaster for hispanic americans  he's pledged to wage attacks on catholic organizations like the little sisters of the poor  they're fighting him  he supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion  extreme late-term  he would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses  he would hand over your jobs to china  and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists  the democrat party also continues to attack our incredible border agents  more than half of whom happen to be hispanic americans  and they're great  and i want to thank not only law enforcement  but a big part of law enforcement  the border patrol and the ice agents  they're incredible  the ice agents  dana could sign some of them up  the ice agents  they go into like a pack  they go at a pack  they go into a pack of ms-13 fighters  these are criminals and they do it like it's routine  you don't want that job  i don't see any of the people  male or female sitting in this audience  that wants that job  ice  they take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country  all around our country  our communities are protected by hispanic american heroes in law enforcement  and they deserve unwavering gratitude  i want to just thank you all  i want to thank you all  with us tonight are members of the national border patrol council and they are great friends of us  i want to just thank them  the official union of our nation's incredible border patrol agents  and you know what  they're not supposed to do it  but they did it anyway  they endorsed me  i want to thank brandon judd  who's here  and art del cueto  art  where's brandon  where is my brandon  where is brandon  look at these guys  look  they're ready  they're ready to fight  hey brandon  art  pick out your toughest guy  i want to see whether or not he can take colby in a fight  don't do it  thank you very much  thanks fellas  we appreciate it very much  thanks  great job too  great job  my administration has achieved the most secure border in american history  we ended catch and release  we stopped asylum fraud  we've deported 20 000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens  we built over 320 miles  as of today  border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week  we're doing about 10 miles a week and we'll be finished with the wall very shortly  and you think  ""that was an easy one "" that was not an easy one  we were fought  two things  and i say it  two things that never get old  remember the democrats are saying  ""a wall won't work "" ""really  tell me about it "" wall works  that's one of the reasons our numbers are so good  but two things that will never get old- 窶ｦ one of the reasons our numbers are so good  but two things that will never get old  never  you know what they are  a wall and a wheel  a wall and a wheel  it'll never get old  a wall  i see so many things and i see all these businesses  computers  you come up with a new chip  you come up with a new computer  you come up with a new laptop  three weeks later  you buy it  three weeks later  it's obsolete  but a wall will never be obsolete  and a wheel will never be obsolete  you come back in a thousand years  a wall and a wheel  thanks to our powerful new security measures  we've doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year  we've doubled  we invested  2 5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in 75 years  the space force  we passed va choice and va accountability  and i've accomplished more in 47 months than joe biden did in 47 years  that's true  that's true  i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  so good for israel  so good that we did that  they paid  150 billion  1 8 billion in cash  i think dana white could have made a slightly better deal than that  you know what we got for it  nothing  we got nothing  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world  and we're talking over a 50 year period  number one in the world  the mass murder of american troops and many other people throughout the world  qasem soleimani is dead  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  and we've achieved the two historic peace deals in the middle east in just the last month  two  two  over 75 years  they did two  we did two in a month  and many other countries are coming in  the united arab emirates and bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with israel  nobody thought this was possible  in fact  you didn't hear it because they don't report this  they just don't want to report it  but they nominated your president twice last week on two different subjects for a nobel prize  but the fake news media didn't cover it  so that's it  biden got it  remember窶ｦ well  okay  remember when our great president  right  barack hussein obama  he got it  right  like immediately  and they said  ""why did you get it "" and he was unable to explain  do you remember  ""why did you get it "" because it was like  he just became president  and they said  ""we're going to nominate barack hussein obama for the nobel peace award  right  and what happened  and then biden said  ""what about me "" they said  ""who the hell is he  this guy  what the hell has he done "" but it's true  obama got it for no reason whatsoever  rick  you know that  no reason whatsoever  joe biden brought you only endless wars  i'm bringing you peace and i'm bringing our troops back home  they're all coming back  endless wars  biden voted for the iraq war  he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed the killing of soleimani  he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world  when i banned china from coming in  highly infected  he said it was hysterical and xenophobic  if we had listened to joe  hundreds of thousands more americans would have died just by that one move alone  when the- thank you  i agree  actually  but i don't think i'm allowed to say it  when the virus arrived  we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  we're delivering life-saving therapies  we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country  anywhere in the world  you don't hear this  europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the us  and despite their very punitive lockdowns  they're once again  seeing very large spikes in cases  unfortunately  the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation and the fastest recovery by far  who's going to do well  and there's a reason for it  through our historic relief programs  we've saved more than half a million nevada jobs and over 42 000 nevada businesses  we've saved 42 000 of your businesses  and he's looking at doing all of this stuff  he will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s  your retirement system  your stocks  he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens  he wants to cut your vet facilities in half  go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million americans' private healthcare plans  which they love  biden pledges to oppose school choice  and he stated that if elected  charter schools are gone  and charter schools have been great  in a second term  i'll provide school choice to every parent in america  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  a limitless future for all americans  it's really a vote for the american dream  that's what it is  it's the american dream versus the american nightmare  instead of letting washington change us  despite all that we've been through  we are changing washington  so in concluding  this wonderful afternoon  and again  don  thank you very much  but in concluding  this wonderful afternoon  and if the governor comes after you  which he shouldn't be doing  i'll be with you all the way  i'll be with you all the way  don't worry about a thing  over the next four years  we'll be making america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end our reliance on china once and for all  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  we will rapidly return to full employment  soaring economies  and record prosperity  we will expand opportunity zones  and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before  we will hire more police  increase penalties for assaults

dollars  have the strongest military we've ever had  beautiful brand new equipment  when i took it over  it was totally depleted  our military  we have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of  things that people have no idea what we have  and let's keep it that way  we will end surprise medical billing  require price transparency already signed  further reduce health insurance premiums  and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon  the drug companies do not like me too much  it's a favored nations clause i signed  we will strongly protect medicare  and your social security will be totally secure  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  america will land the first woman on the moon  and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  when i took over  nasa was a shell of itself  it was closed  they had grass growing in the runways  grass growing in the runways  now it's the number one space center in the world by far  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools  we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  we will live by the timeless words of our national motto  in god we trust  and we're going to keep it that way  for years  you had a

13,10,Dec,2019,datasets/Hershey,"well  thank you to vice president pence  thank you  mike  and hello pennsylvania  hello  it's great to be back in this state that gave us the liberty bell  pennsylvania steel  hershey chocolate  i like hershey chocolate  the nittany lions  the nittany lions  they're doing pretty well too and the incredible american patriots just like you  you are patriots  thank you very much  thank you  under republican leadership  america is stronger than ever before and we are respected again  last month you saw it  we smashed expectations with another 266 000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low  we have never seen what's going on with different groups  unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this  you are so lucky i became your president  i'm only kidding  i have to say i'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that  they'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say  ""he said they were lucky to have him as president  what a horrible thing to say "" because they're fake  anyway  here in pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country  not bad  the pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low  and i hate to tell you this  when i was campaigning three and a half years ago  i'd come here  you weren't doing so well  folks  you weren't doing so well  wages were way down  unemployment was way up  it wasn't a pretty picture  just a few months ago  i visited the new shell petrochemical plant in beaver county at  6 billion with a b   6 billion  it is the largest investment in pennsylvania history  we're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state  for generations  american manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy  the bedrock  remember the last administration  "" you need a magic wand  it'll never come back "" we found the magic wand  didn't we  then came nafta  the nafta disaster  i call it  one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three pennsylvania manufacturing jobs  your politicians always pledged to fix it  they'd talk about it for years and years and decades  but they never were able to do it  they came and they went to washington and they did nothing  but unlike those politicians  i keep my promises  and i love pennsylvania  i went to school in pennsylvania  you know that right  i know it well  and i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all  congress will soon vote on my new trade deal  the us-mexico-canada agreement or usmca  after years of waiting  many  many years  many  many decades  they've been looking for this  and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for nancy pelosi to announce usmca and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the united states and your favorite president  i think  and the reason they announced it on the same day  one hour later  they announce impeachment  a few guys standing behind her  they announced the impeachment  and then an hour later  she announced that she's going to usmca  you know why  it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment  and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment  and think of it this way also  the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt  that's the reason they approved usmca  so that's okay with me  because they approved it and they're very happy to have it  but honestly  it's an incredible deal for our country  took too long  it waited in congress for too long a time  incredible deal  and replacing the worst  nafta  we've also just reached a deal with congress to invest a record  738 billion more into our great military  when i took over  i will tell you  i became president窶ｦ think of it  almost three years ago  by the way  was that the most exciting night ever  i'm just watching these people  that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint  from an excitement standpoint  what the hell would they do without me and you  they'd be gone  about a month before i ran  i picked up a new york times  it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick  they've got all their reporters covering trump  trump  trump  i can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning  you know what happens  they all go down the tombs they got  all of them  washington post  new york times  those very dishonest networks  they are very dishonest  very  very dishones  no  they're very dishonest people  and i have to say this  look  and i always have to say this  you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications  but not too many of them  i have to be honest with you  well  you know that  does anybody think the media is honest  does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest  all right  the legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at  and a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall  which we're building窶ｦ the wall is going on  it gets one of the biggest applause of anything  it's the sixth branch of the united states armed forces  the space force  we're opening up the space force because you know what  that's where it's at  and everything's built right here in the united states  that's simple  and by the way  we build the greatest weapons  the greatest planes  the greatest ships  we build it in the united states  there's nobody that comes close  we have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world  rockets and missiles  no place builds it like us  we have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the united states  we've never had a thing like this  we are so hot  we are so hot  and just a few weeks ago  the united states special forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice  thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors  and they're great warriors  the bloodthirsty savage known as al baghdadi is now dead  and he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead  and we've got our eye on and our sights on third also  we know exactly where and when  but it's becoming a very unpopular job  not a lot of takers and that's what we want  go back to living a good normal life because america is winning again  america is winning again like never before  and as i always say  and i've already said it twice tonight  this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago  we were laughed at  but while we're delivering historic victories for the american people  the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes  nullify the election and overthrow our democracy  not going to happen  don't worry about it  i wouldn't lose too much sleep over it  and i have to say this about the republicans  the republicans窶ｦ and you have a lot of great ones here tonight  your congressman  you have a lot of great ones  these congressmen are great  the republicans have never been so united as they are right now  ever  the house  the senate  we've never been this united because it's all a hoax and they understand it  they also understand poll numbers  but i'm sure that had nothing to do with it  but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote  or in the alternative  trying to win the 2020 election  that's not going to happen  yesterday  the justice department's inspector general released a report detailing the outrageous  scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power  get them out  get her out  get her out  get her out  see  these guys want to be so politically correct  you get her out  you see that  i'll tell you  law enforcement is so great  that particular guy wanted to be so politically correct  we don't want to be politically correct  i don't know who he was  he didn't do the greatest job  so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous窶ｦ it all started with the russia witch hunt  then the inspector general shocking report proved that the obama fbi obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears  paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc  the fbi failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the pfizer court  they hid it  they deceived it  and they lied  the dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote  ""desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the united states president "" what's this  folks  they spied on our campaign  they spied  never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it  we're wise to it  the inspector general found that the fbi spying application contained 17 errors and omissions  commonly known as lies and deceit  when the fbi窶ｦ and you have great people in the fbi  but not in leadership  you have not good people in leadership  you haven't had  when the fbi uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong  which was right at the beginning  they hid that exonerating  you know that  they hid it  they hid it so nobody could see it  so they could keep this hoax going on for two years  they knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up  a set up  but they hid it so that nobody could see it  so they could keep it going on  thinking they were going to hurt us politically  but now we're stronger politically than we were ever before  and the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign  look how they've hurt people  they've destroyed the lives of people that were great people  that are still great people  their lives have been destroyed by scum  by scum  an fbi lawyer forged  took an email窶ｦ forged  forged an email used as evidence  an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral  what they did is so unbelievable  oh  i look forward窶ｦ i don't know  i don't know  keep away  i look forward to bull durham's report  that's the one i look forward to  and this report was great by the ig  especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama  considering that fact  it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously  although i suspect we would have  we also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- trump and anti-trump people hatred and bias  texting about an insurance policy  let's have an insurance窶ｦ remember  remember  peter strzok and his lover  lisa page  remember  ""lisa  i love you so much  lisa  please  lisa please  lisa  i've never loved anyone like you  we won't allow this to happen to our country  lisa  please tell me you love me  lisa  i love you "" ""peter  i love you  i love you like i've never loved anyone  and if for any reason she loses  even though she's a stone called corrupt person  if for any reason she loses  peter  we've got to have an insurance policy  we have to do it because we're going to go窶ｦ "" and that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years  it was their phony insurance policy  so fbi lawyer  lisa page  so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of counter intelligence  peter strzok  likewise so in love he couldn't see straight  this poor guy  did i hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from lisa  that's what i heard  i don't know if it's true  the fake news will never report it  but it could be true  no  that's what i heard  i don't know  i mean who could believe a thing like that  no  i heard that peter strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover  ah  lisa  i hope you're miss him  lisa  he'll never be the same  but he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok look back  ""no  no  he won't  we'll stop it  we'll stop it "" can you believe we found these texts  this is fbi agents at a high level  ""no  no  we'll stop it "" they're going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen  ""there was no bias  oh  there was no bias "" think of these people  they write here was no bias  and yet he saying  ""no  no  darling  we'll stop it "" and then they announce there was no bias  now you know what we're doing  and it's not easy  and somebody said a regular president窶ｦ i don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer窶ｦ a regular president would have been under a table  thumb in the mouth saying  ""take me home mommy  this is too tough for me "" it's true  true  they know  and while it was tough on my family  i have to say  very unfair to my family  very tough on my family  i have a great family  tough窶ｦ for me  it's my life  i do it  i do it  it's one thing  but very tough on a family thing  a thing like this happens  it's a disgrace  but day after day we're exposing something called that filthy  disgusting  horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up  and now after and a half years now that the russia witch hunt is dead  a big fat disgusting fraud  the congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine  but that's already failing  you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today  people are saying they're not even a crime  what happened  all of these horrible things  remember  bribery and this and that  where are they  they send these two things and not even a crime  this is the lightest  weakest impeachment窶ｦ  our country has had actually many impeachments  you recall judges and lots of窶ｦ many impeachments  but it was on today  everybody said  ""this is impeachment light "" this is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far  it's not even like an impeachment  these people are stone cold crooked  when a guy like shifty schiff  he's a corrupt politician  he made up my statement because窶ｦ see  i did one thing very good  as soon as i heard about this deal  i released my statement immediately  but he had already made horrible statements  and by the way  the whistleblower  the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game  remember the second whistleblower was coming  right  and then the informer  who is the informer  i know who the informer is  so the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report  they wrote something totally different from what i said  what i said was perfect  but it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that  they didn't even know probably that we had it transcribed  professionally transcribed  word for word transcribed  so beautiful  am i lucky i had it transcribed  think of that  think of that  so when i said release it窶ｦ and i don't like doing that because you're releasing it  it's a conversation with a foreign leader  in this case  a very fine gentlemen  president of ukraine  the new president of ukraine  and we call them up and we said  ""would it be okay "" our secretary of state made the call  ""would it be okay "" and they didn't know what we were talking about  but they said  ""yeah  it's okay "" and by the way  he  his foreign minister  everybody did you know they said  ""there was no pressure  he didn't do anything wrong  there was no pressure put on us "" that didn't stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up  now  all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower  we never heard about who the informer was  the whistleblower who's going to come out strong  he's disappeared  where's the whistleblower  he's disappeared  he's gone  maybe our great congressman can find him  he's gone  maybe our great congressmen can find him  okay  but the whistleblower is gone  he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly  and the ig  who didn't want to look at the conversation  he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to congress so that congress could have fun with it  ought to be ashamed of himself  but today  the house democrats announced these two flimsy  pathetic  ridiculous articles of impeachment  the house democrats are walking back from everything they claimed  with today's announcement  they're now admitting there was no collusion  there was no obstruction of justice  and there were no crimes whatsoever  there are no crimes  it says that  there are no crimes  they're impeaching me and there are no crimes  this has to be a first in history  they're impeaching me  you know why  because they want to win an election  and that's the only way they can do it  so the democrats have nothing  and they've turned the somber process of impeachment  and it was  you know  to me  impeachment is a very ugly word  it's a word i associate with some very bad times in our country  the good news is we're having the best times in history in our country  okay  but the word impeachment  to me  is a very  very ugly word  it's a dark  ugly word  but  but i have to tell you  as bad as it is  it meant something  when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors  when you had serious  go ahead  it's impeachment  that would happen every 50 years  every 40 years  every 100 years  this was a big deal  they're making it so like  ""let's do it every six months "" they've cheapened a process  they've cheapened a process  these people are so bad  the radical left democrats  and i actually think that pelosi  who by the way  by the way  by the way  she has totally lost control  she has totally 窶ｦ it's being run now by this crazy aoc plus three  aoc plus three  now it's being run by other people  the far left has just grabbed that party  it is so sad to see  and she knew what would happen  i didn't  because i didn't figure the polls would go through the roof  they went out today  in michigan  in wisconsin  in a place called pennsylvania  no  no  the polls are through the roof  they're called swing states  very important states  we won pennsylvania the last time  and we're going to win it again  but even bigger  our polls have gone  over the last month  they've gone through the roof  you look at it  take a look at it  it came out today  the firehouse poll  it's an important poll  it was always good  i never looked at it  today  i like it a lot  we're up through 窶ｦ nobody can even believe it  so what pelosi did  and as i said  they do the impeachment  then right away  let's do usmca  right on top of it  you'd think she'd wait like a day  she wanted to smother the impeachment crap  and that's probably what she did  at least to an extent  but any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority  their dignity  and their career  okay  and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time  think of this  how about low iq maxine waters  how about green  how about green  we've green  how about green  where he said  ""we have to impeach him because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election "" this is what we're dealing with  you know  we're dealing with some very bad people  we're dealing with people that don't respect you  and by the way  you know they talk about the elite  you're the elite  they're not the elite  you're the elite  you're the elite  you got better education  you got better everything  you're the elite  it always bothers me  they said  ""the elite "" this is the elite  look at these people  how beautiful  this is the elite  you know who are the elite  you look at those jobs reports  we're the best in history unemployment for african americans  best in history unemployment hispanic americans  best in history unemployment asian americans  you're the elite  you're the elite  but they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust  they'll do it again  and by the way  the senate's been so professional  so good  so strong  so solid  just like these gentlemen in the house  so solid  so we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office  and in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house  we have to take over the house  we have to  right  got to take over the house  mike  so here are the facts that shifty schiff 窶ｦ is that guy the worst  he comes up to a microphone  now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago  ""i have absolute proof that the president of the united states conspired with russia "" russia  what the hell do i have to do with russia  by the way  russia wishes that hillary clinton won  they wish  we are now number one in the world in energy  russia is number three  we're beating out russia and saudi arabia  you'd have windmills all over the place if you had crooked hillary  they'd be knocking out those birds left and right  those windmills  wah  wah  wah  ""darling  i want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind  what do i do  i want to watch the election results  darling  there's no wind  the damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming  i think  i think it's global warming  global warming  no more wind  no more life  the ocean is going to rise 1/8 of an inch within the next 250 years  we're going to be wiped out "" look  i want clean air  i want clean water  crystal clean  i want  and that's what we have at a record level  our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing  and we haven't closed up all of our industry  and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs  and right now  we're by far the largest economy in the world  if you remember  you could look  if you go back five  six  seven years  in 2019 they say china was going to catch us as the world's largest economy  guess what  they're way behind  they're way behind  because over the last three years  you see the stock market set 131 records from the day  think of that  and that means jobs  that means 401ks  i have so many people that come up to me  ""thank you  sir  my wife is so in love with me because i went up 79% in the 401k  she thinks i'm a genius  she always thought i was a total stiff  a dumb  stupid dope  now she thinks i'm a financial genius  sir  and all i did was buy some stock  i have stock in a 401k  and you made me into a genius  sir  she loves me so much more than she ever did "" shows you the power of money  right  isn't that terrible  but i have so many people  401ks are through the roof  your jobs are through the roof  we have the lowest unemployment rate  and now  more importantly than anything  wages are up for the first time in many  many years  decades  decades  you remember four years ago i was here  and i told people  i said  ""you know  20 years ago  people made more money than they made four years ago "" not now  not anymore  because people now can not only make a lot more money  if they don't like their job  they go out and they get a different job  and they get more money  and ultimately they find one that they love  you have so many opportunities right now  wages are up  jobs are up  and today we set a new record  almost 160 million people are working  we've never come close to that number  that's a hell of a number  but just quickly  here are the facts on shifty schiff  dishonest guy  makes up my statements  he said  ""the president of ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure "" but he didn't want to say that  we said  ""say it  say it  you crooked bastard  say it  but he doesn't want to say it  we said  ""sat it "" i'd like to force him to say it  he'll walk up to the mic  ""ladies and gentlemen "" guy's a total corrupt guy  listen  just to finish off  a man who i really  i don't know him  but i respect him because the ukrainian foreign minister  and he said it so strongly  ""i have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance "" he just said that the democrats  who are corrupt  refuse to say that  and that's ultimately the only one that matters  the leaders of ukraine  because they're the ones that know of this pressure  not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater  or that's a bushy  or that's a clintonite  or that's a barack obama ambassador  okay  the ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about  they refuse to say it because they're dishonest people  there's only one way to stop the rabid partisan democrats  pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the house  hold the senate  and keep the white house  it's the only way  only way  okay  so i'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight  we love warriors  like the guys that killed al-baghdadi  you know how much press i got  i don't care about press  but conan the dog got more than i did  and that's okay  conan was almost electrocuted  he deserves it  they gave me about a day  and that's okay  because the people understand  we made a great decision  and remember this  al-baghdadi was the founder of isis  al-baghdadi was a vicious  ruthless person  al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio  think of that  that's a big caliphate  and we now have taken 100% of the caliphate  and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners  with obama  you did nothing  you did nothing but get your ass kicked  true  true  all right  we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways  they fight for us  they really are incredible  and they come right from the state of pennsylvania  hey  do you ever notice where biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state  like if he's in ohio  ""it's great to be an iowa tonight "" if he's in pennsylvania  ""it's wonderful to be in the state of delaware "" what is wrong with this guy  what's wrong with him  there's something wrong  okay  there's something wrong  no  he keeps 窶ｦ how many times can you do that  so far  it could happen  because you know i was doing six and seven a day that last month  that last beautiful month that i loved  i was doing six  i left these guys alone  i didn't want to do interviews  they were a waste of time  we just did these big beautiful rallies  and you know  if you start getting a little 窶ｦ you know  i went to michigan  then i went to wisconsin  then i went 窶ｦ i'm sitting here saying  ""what the hell is going on  these crowds are incredible "" and we had the biggest crowds  by the way  to this day  there has never been  and they'll always correct me  in the history of politics  in the history of our country  there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw  and i don't have a guitar  i have no guitar  but this has never happened  i mean if you took ronald reagan  and we all like ronald reagan  i liked him  i thought he was a great guy  but if he came to pennsylvania for a rally  if he had 1 000 people in a ballroom or something  you know  i mean we're getting crowds  25-30 000 people  and then there'll be 20 000 people outside  we set up screens outside  and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching  and do you people out there  i'm sorry  it's pretty rough  but no  there's never been anything like it  one instruction get me the biggest arena you can get  we don't have empty seats  i mean look at this  how many seats is this  11 000  how much  10 500  it's packed  it's beyond that  and don't forget  look at the floor  and then you go out  no  and then you go out and you look outside  and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing  we're fixing our country  we're healing our country  we're making america great again  so i want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward  representative glenn thompson  come up here  glenn  come up here  a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time  mike kelly  don't get in the fight with mike  come up  mike  a wonderful man who represents this area  scott perry  representative lloyd smucker  lloyd  a guy who was always there for us  john joyce  and two people that you all know very well in this state  they bring home the bacon  dan meuser and fred keller  thank you fellas  thank you  i want to also bring back our pennsylvania party chairman  and i know his grandfather  i shouldn't say that to you  he was a tremendous man  dan tabas  but i'm going to introduce somebody that dan always said had tremendous talent  little did i know that he'd be working with us  and he's really working well  he's smart  he's tough  lawrence tabas  come on up  lawrence  come on up  also with us tonight  pennsylvania trump victory chairwoman  bernie  you know this  right  you know this person  comfort  do you know who that is  do you know who that is  everybody knows who that is  national committeeman bob asher  rnc co-chairman tommy hicks has been incredible  and my friend david urban  david  so i just want to thank  this is an amazing group of people  and with their help  and the help of everyone here  we are going to set records like we've never set before  you know  i used to say  and i sort of still have to say  2016  i don't know if anything like that can ever happen  but i think we're much better  all of the things i said  ""we're going to cut taxes  we're going to cut regulations  we're going to take care of our vets "" look what we did for our vets  with choice  right  look what we did  look what we did  we now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the va  right  fired over 8 000 people that were disrespecting our vets  they wouldn't have done it in primetime  i can tell you that  but what we've done for our vets  what we've done in rebuilding our military  what we've done in so many ways  and we  unlike the democrats  will protect your second amendment  okay  so we've done a job  and we're proud of it  and we have tremendous people  let's give them a hand  and thank you very much  thank you  thank you  everybody  thank you  thank you  folks  vote for these people  even if you don't like them  vote for them  oh  that's a beautiful new hat  look at the hat that guy's got on  how's that hat working out  is that good  i love that hat  look at this guy  that says keep america great  should we do the poll  should we do a poll  okay  ready  so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics  make america great again  wait  and we have our new phrase  because we've made america great  i've told you  stock market  we've rebuilt our military  we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible  take a look at your median income  take a look at what's happened  the numbers  median household income  take a look at your numbers  with president bush  it went up  400 in eight years  with president obama  it went up  975 in eight years  with president trump  it went up 5 000  but whoa  whoa  whoa  in less than three years  that's a big thing  wait  and then when you add energy savings  and you add tax savings  you have almost a  10 000 gain in three years  that's a big difference  and that's one of the very big reasons why our  i think that and regulations  but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well  because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money  thank you very much  mr  president  i appreciate it  but with the help of everyone here  we have now the hottest economy  you know when i meet dictators  and presidents  and kings  and queens  and prime ministers  they all come into that beautiful oval office  so beautiful  right  so respected  and the first thing they almost always say  ""sir  congratulations on your economy  we're trying to do the same thing "" i said  ""you won't be able to do it  you won't "" they won't be able to  let them give it a shot  but they all say  ""congratulations on the great job you've done with economy "" but we've all done the great job  not me  we've all done it  i've been your spokesman  and i've done a good job as spokesman  but they all say that  but we've done a good job in many ways  you know  all of the promises that i made  i'm the only politician in history that i've actually kept more promises than i made  think of that  in other words  i made here  like a thing like right to try  nobody talked about right to try  we got right to try  that's somebody terminally ill  we have the greatest medicines in the world  the greatest doctors  the greatest labs in the world  nobody close  but it takes years to get it approved  and i got it approved so you can sign a document  get it  if you want to see the lives that we're saving  it's a beautiful thing  a beautiful thing is happening  right to try  right to try  but we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election  if i would have said that  the fake news would have gone crazy  they would have said that's impossible  these people would have gone crazy  they go crazy anyway  and i don't even say it  and right here in pennsylvania  we've created 160  000 brand new beautiful jobs  and you have companies moving in and moving back  and as i said  african american  hispanic american  asian american unemployment  the lowest ever in the history of our country  the lowest unemployment rates  wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10%  nobody thought that was possible  they're one of the biggest  in terms of a group  one of the biggest beneficiaries  this year  40 million american families will benefit from the republican child tax credit  each receiving an average of  2 200  we ended the last administration's war on american energy  the united states is now  and i said it  and i'll say it all night long  number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world  and there's nobody even close  in the state of pennsylvania  natural gas production is up 34% since our election  34  virtually every leading democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate american production of oil  clean coal  natural gas  i don't think somebody coming into pennsylvania  you know those new petrochemical plants  they don't like them at all  thousands and thousands of jobs  incredible  millions of dollars in taxes  how about going to the state of texas  we had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate  right  beto  beto  remember  so he wanted to get rid of religion  the bible  he wanted to get rid of guns  and he wanted to get rid of oil  how about going to texas and say  ""no bible  no oil "" think of this one  ""no bible  no oil  no guns "" i think you could be abraham lincoln and not win that particular race  and it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania  that i can tell you  but you know  somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden  he was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in pennsylvania  you saw that  but the voters of this commonwealth will never  ever let that happen  can you imagine a guy coming in  whether it's him or anybody else  they all want to do it  he just raises his hand  he has no clue what he's doing  they raise their hand  remember he looked  do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare  even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up 窶ｦ and he looks and they're all raising their hand  did you see that  well  he  ""oh  oh  oh  okay  i'll do it too "" in addition to replacing nafta  i've taken the toughest ever action against china's trade abuses  they want to make a deal so badly  and we're doing well with the deal  but they want to make a deal  ""please make a deal  we don't want to pay tariffs anymore  please  please "" thanks to our steel tariffs  steel mills in pennsylvania are roaring back to life  and u s  steel has just announced  1 billion investment in mon valley works in pittsburgh  you know that  right   1 billion  they weren't investing  they were divesting  the steel companies  it's an amazing achievement  we tax all of the dumped steel  comes in from china and other places  25%  窶ｦ the dump steel comes in from china and other places  25%  all of it  all of a sudden our steel mills are doing again  we need steel  it's not like you could say  ""gee  we'll get it from another country "" we need that for defense  we need it for our ships  we need it for our planes  we need it  we can't play games with steel  after years of rebuilding other nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  very importantly  in everything we do  we are putting america first  sorry  we gave up on the globalist folks  let's build the world  let's forget about our country  let's just rebuild the world  or no issue have the democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on the issue of immigration  far left politician窶ｦ i mean  they're fighting me on the wall  you have no idea  but we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military  i've got it from here  from there  from there  believe me  if i weren't a good developer  you could forget about that wall  i've got here  there  there  these people fought me and we've started winning in court  you know what  speaking of court  we will soon have 182 federal judges  including court of appeals  nobody can believe it  all because barack obama gave us 142 empty seats  when you're a president  they always say  ""i disagree  i think the most important thing we can do is defense "" right  but beyond defense  they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the supreme court  we have two great ones  great ones  but they always say  ""judges and supreme court justices "" when you leave office  i hope in 5 years  9 years  13 years  17 years  21 years  25 years  29 years  when i leave office窶ｦ now i'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy  that drives them crazy  even joking about it  we have this idiot comedian who stands up  he's talking to a guest  right  he said  ""you know he's going to win  don't you  you know it "" the guy goes  ""no  no  we're going to fight  we're going to fight "" and they will  ""no  no  no  you know he's going to win "" then he goes  ""you know he's going to win  and you know he's never leaving  don't you  he's never leaving "" at first i thought he was kidding  he's a whack job  he is totally serious  he honestly believes that  i don't know  should we give it a shot  maybe we'll give it a shot  i'm only kidding  i'm only kidding  media  i'm only kidding  they won't write that  but that's okay  they won't write the  ""i'm only kidding part "" but far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt  scorned and disdained for everyday americans  these jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous  violent  criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets  where they are free to offend  where they are free to kill  where they are free to rape  where they are free to beat up people except for ice because ice is much tougher than them  they don't beat up ice  they don't beat up ice  you're lucky we have ice  they want to put ice out of business  that's not happening  ice is窶ｦ they're incredible people  they're great patriots and they're tough  thanks to democrat immigration policies  innocent americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals  last summer  at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides  including hacking victims to death and ripping out  in two cases  their hearts  weeks ago  two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang  ms-13  who we are removing from our country by the thousands  were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful  beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete  one of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ice demand  ice warned and said  ""you can't let them go "" they wanted them  they would do anything for them  they wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country  get them the hell out of our country  right  democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes  since montgomery county  maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in july  we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape  sexual assault  including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young  wonderful woman who was entering her apartment  innocently entering her apartment  she was raped and killed  strangled to death  sanctuary city  maryland  but these are only the cases we know about  sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government  federal government wants to take them out  or in some cases  if it's real violence  and we don't want to pay for the cost  but we do  put them into very strong jails  the sanctuary city of philadelphia  the sanctuary city in philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in america  did you know that  i mean  i know philadelphia well  going to school here  we never heard about sanctuary cities  did we  weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape  sexual assault of a child  and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by philadelphia to wander free in your communities  by the way  you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it  this guy  i've been hearing about this guy  he lets killers out almost immediately  what the hell  how did you let that happen  instead of handing them over while still in jail  they defied ice  they fought with ice and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family  thankfully  at great time and effort  our brave ice officers were eventually able to track him down  arrest him  detain him  and do what has to be done  how do you elect democrats when they create a sanctuary city of philadelphia  i don't get it  four ms-13 gang members were also arrested in pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old  as we speak  a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in pennsylvania because he was released by the city of philadelphia  the city of brotherly love  you better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place  i want to tell you  that's a horrible thing  no  it's a national story  how he wants everybody to not pay the price  you're talking about not paying the price for rape  for murder  for other horrible crimes  how stupid can you be  the charges against this alien include rape  aggravated indecent assault  unlawful contact with a minor  indecent exposure  and terroristic threats  other than that  he was a very nice person  philadelphia has defied ice and released illegals charged with everything from assault  to kidnapping  to drug crimes  to sex crimes  to homicide murder  democrats stand for crime  corruption  and chaos  republicans stand for law and order  and we stand for justice  we stand for justice  we side with law enforcement and with law-abiding americans  not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals  aliens that come into our country illegally  they take our payments  payments  some of these people with these crazy laws that you have  look at what's going on in california  they do better than our great veterans  they do better than citizens of our country  and they advertise  ""we will take you  we will take care of you  we will pay for it "" and then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders  but we do a great job  we're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands  we're sending them home  and we're not letting them come back in  we're being very tough  mexico is now giving us 27 000 soldiers at our border  and guatemala  honduras  and el salvador  we signed a very important agreement with each  when their people come into our country  they weren't taking them back  now they take them back and they say  ""thank you very much "" they weren't taking them back  if we had a murderer from honduras  guatemala  el salvador  we want to bring them back under past administrations  they bring them and they say  ""we don't want them  don't land  you're playing with us "" they say  ""thank you very much  we will take them back "" because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossings are down 75% since may and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace  the radical democrats have gotten more and more extreme  that's why they did this impeachment hoax  because nancy pelosi had absolutely no control  she knew what was going to happen  she knew  the radical left has taken over the democrat party  democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice  we have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it  they're going to take it away from you  i don't think so  crazy elizabeth warren  or as i affectionately call her  pocahontas  her ridiculous plan would cost  52 trillion  that's more money than we take in in one year  two years  three years  four years  five years  six years  about seven years  that's for one year   52 trillion  and you don't have your doctor  i mean  the whole窶ｦ well  she's starting to crash again  i thought i knocked her down  i did that heavy  heavy pocahontas deal  i give her credit  i thought she was left for窶ｦ i mean  there were just little embers  and then she rose  she rose  then she became strong  but then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped  it stopped  i don't see her as a threat  i don't think she makes it  i mean  you don't know  crazy things are happening in the democrat party  it used to be a sane party  now it's an insane party  so you don't know  but they're all looking at the same thing  i mean  you have alfred e  neuman who's running  who's this guy  this guy buttigieg  buttigieg  can you believe he's doing well  he's like the leading fundraiser  i dream about him  it's true  no  buttigieg  but i'm not going too far with any of these people because i thought i was way too early with elizabeth warren  we destroyed her too fast  so she came back  but she's going back down again  did anybody see her beer deal where she said  ""darling "" did you ever see that deal  darling  it's about her husband  darling  it's great to see you  what are you doing here  it's like  ""that's her husband  he's supposed to be living in the house  you're here "" i don't think she's seen him in 10 years  hey  i have an idea  can i get a beer  let's get a beer  she wants to be one of the group  hey  let's get a beer  did you ever see such a phony  disgusting deal  republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor  and you can choose your plan  and you choose the plan that's right for you  we will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions  we will also protect your right to get the physician that you want  virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the moment of birth  this character in virginia  did you see the virginia governor  i mean  he gave a whole expose  the baby is born  and then basically  they start talking to the mother  the baby is born  and there's no other word  if the mother decides no  then they execute the baby  okay  he's the governor of virginia and why the republicans aren't going to win virginia this next election  2020  i'll tell you what  we're going to give it a very strong shot  when you have people like that  we're going to give it a very strong shot  but that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and the party of honest abe lincoln  party of abe lincoln  i told you about judges  i'm telling you about so many other things  there's nobody that's ever done what we're doing  you look at school choice for every child in america who needs it  including the 50 000 pennsylvania students who your democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships  no scholarships available  what's that all about  how did that happen  i withdrew from the horrible  one-sided iran nuclear deal  a disaster  i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for the people of pennsylvania  you've never had that better year  never at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation itself  it's the survival  we will destroy our country if these people get in  i say we've done so much in the first three years  will soon be four years  all of a sudden the time will be up  but it's like when you plant a tree  it needs time to grab on  it needs time to let it窶ｦ it's got to grab  that's what we need  we need time  and we have other things we're going to do that are incredible  we still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do  we've cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country  we did it in less than two and a half years  two and a half years  we did it in less than two and a half years  some had eight years  one had more than eight years  more regulation  and we have regulation  and you need some regulation  but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway  so what we've done has been incredible  that's one of the reasons our job numbers are so good  if you want your children to inherit the birthright of american liberty that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020  and we have to get rid of the democrats in the house of representatives  they are stone cold crazy  only this way can we save the america we love and clean up washington corruption once and for all  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  we have tremendous prosperity going on in our country  and the people in this room are窶ｦ i mean  you know what's happening  you know what's happening with your families  you know what's happening with your jobs  you've never had a time like this  they always say  ""are you better off now than you were four years ago "" i mean  who is better off now  everybody  i think  everybody  but together  we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  ""made in the usa "" we just finished a deal with south korea  a great new trade deal  we just finished a  40 billion deal with japan  we're in the process of getting our deal done  let's see what happens  they want to make it more than i do with because we're taking in a lot of money  we haven't taken in money from china ever  and it's coming in now by the billions  when they target our farmer  i give our farmers that money that they've been targeted and our farmers are thrilled  we have a lot leftover  but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer  and ending the aids epidemic in america  we'll have that done within 10 years  it could have started  that could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration  we'll have that done in less than 10 years  think of that  the aids epidemic will have ended in america within less than 10 years  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  one great country  one america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto  ""in god we trust "" we stand on the shoulders of generations of pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood  sweat  and tears for this beloved nation  pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared american independence  where the army weathered its brutal winter at valley forge  and where general george washington led his men across the delaware on christmas night  they used the password  you know what the password was  victory or death  victory or death  how incredible is that  victory or death  pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of american industry  from andrew carnegie to milton hershey  i love hershey  i love hershey  and henry j  heinz  pennsylvania is the place where strong american workers mine the coal  work the railroads  and forge the steel that made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world  and we are making it even greater every single day  it's greater than ever before  and proud citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  they are trying to take your power away  it will never ever happen  with your help  and with your devotion  and your drive we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are going to keep on winning  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  ladies and gentlemen of pennsylvania  the best is

14,21,Feb,2020,datasets/LasVegas,"well  thank you very much  and hello las vegas  great to be with you  they have a big election tomorrow  we've already won the state  we've already won  i like ours better  we just take it  just take it  we've won it  i like it that better  you know they say they're going to have a lot of problems tomorrow  i hate to tell you this  i don't know  have you heard  i hear their computers are all messed up  just like they were in iowa  they're not going to be able to count their vote  they're going to tell you about healthcare  they're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets  but they can't count votes  they just can't count them  they can't count votes  but they're saying they may not be able to do it again  they're still trying to tell us  i called up yesterday  how are they doing in iowa  was that two weeks ago  they say we're getting close  they're not getting close  they'll never know  they'll never know  but i hear the same thing could happen tomorrow  i hope it doesn't  actually  i hope it doesn't  but i'm delighted to be back in a state i love  i have a beautiful building right down the road  with the proud  hardworking patriots of nevada  you're going to say nevada  you say that wrong  you got problems  you say nevada  they go  what the hell  got to be nevada  with your help this november  we're going to defeat the radical socialist democrats and we are going to win nevada in a big beautiful landslide  now  we have some special people here  you know the special very special people  and we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports  some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports  it was called the miracle on ice  do you remember that  that was when the russians had a team assembled  that was probably  they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled  they were unbelievable  and our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before  and i hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3  and the usa was not on top  and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing  but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the united states men's hockey team defeated then soviet union team in the 1980 olympics  incredible  that was incredible  most of you remember that  i'm looking  we've got a lot of young ones  but we've got a lot of people that remember that  a lot of people  and by the way  we got the olympics coming back or coming to los angeles  thank you  thank you president trump  thank you president trump  thank you very much  thank you president trump  eight years  eight years  2028 you know what  unless i'm still president then  which is a distinct possibility  i won't be here  and you know what they'll do  i'll say  how's the olympics going  does anybody have a ticket for the president that got the olympics to come here  they'll say  i want to thank and they'll thank hundreds of people  but they won't thank you president that i'm the one that pulled it off  but that's okay  2028 olympics is coming to los angeles  it's going to be great  and we worked with the mayor of los angeles  he was great  he called up and we gave him a lot of help  i was president elect then because the president didn't want to get involved  he didn't want to get involved in getting the olympics  so they called me and i was president elect  hadn't taken office  then i got involved and i'll tell you  they were happy we got involved  it was great  it's going to be very exciting today  we are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team  give him a big hand  and they were amazed  they said  boy is a big crowd  i said  it's only because you guys are coming  this day was supposed to be for this evening  and i said  let me get back to washington  do it early  so we gave you almost no notice  you have thousands of people outside  thousands of people inside  you had to see  we were in iowa we were in new hampshire  you saw what happened in colorado last  that was unbelievable  every place we go it's the same  it's been incredible  i don't know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in colorado  it was incredible  it was  you could have filled that arena up four times and it was a big arena  and it's something  so i hated to do it to you at 12 o'clock but i said  let's go  i want to get back  we got to deal with china  we got to deal with russia  we got to deal with north korea  south korea  we got to deal with the rest of the world  get my people back  we got to get the hell out of here  right  but we have a lot of time  i'd like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage  a friend of mine and a very good golfer  by the way  captain mike he rode a bike  mike  where's mike  where is he  mike  do you know who he is  he's a fake handicap is what he is  say something mike  just welcome everybody to ironic we happen to be here to celebrate our 40th anniversary  the vegas knights flew the whole team out to honor us tonight and for the weekend and we obviously thank the people of las vegas for having us here and we're looking forward to celebrating a special time  and it's a great honor for the president to invite us to be part of this event as well  so vegas  thanks for having us  but just tell them  am i a good athlete and am i a good golfer  thanks mike  that was some goaltending right  how many did you rebuff  i mean  but how many did jim have  many did  very few  but a lot of shots  right  he was like a pinata  so mike  that was great  goaltender jim craig  so jim rebuffed come here  jim  great goaltender  great goaltender  they didn't know what was happening  they kept shooting  he doesn't know how many you rebuffed  how many did you rebuff  37  so let me ask you  was that as goaltender  because that was incredible  was that the greatest game you ever played  you've had a lot of great games  but was that the greatest game you've ever played  it was slightly important  37  37  bill baker  bill  come up  bill baker  dave christian  ken morrow  jack o'callahan  mike ramsey  those legs took a beating  mark wells  neil brotton  john harrington  rob mcclanahan  buzz schneider  dave silk  phil verchota  and a great coach and assistant coach at the time  craig patrick  they said four more years  12 more years left for them  look at that  look at the press  hey mike  look at the fake news back there  it's a lot  i always say that's like the academy awards used to be  this year  we had a movie  they said best movie  they announced the movie from south korea  i said  what's that all about  the movie was made in south korea  look  i get along great with south korea  but you know  i never saw that one before  they used to go best foreign movie  but now we do it that way  i don't get it  but that's what it used to be and this is really an incredible time  i'll tell you what  for our country  that's why i like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do  nobody can do it like us  we're the greatest country in the world again  we have the greatest people  we have the greatest military by far  we've totally rebuilt our military  jobs are booming  incomes are surging  poverty is plummeting  factories are returning confidence is soaring  like these guys  the confidence is soaring  but you know  we do have somebody that i'd like to point out because this team is  they had a coach  and that coach was a very inspirational coach  would you say mike  and i'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about coach brooks because he was very  very  he was really a big  he was a big heart on this team  please  say something  so tell me one thing  one thing  so i see those tears  that means you think  you miss him and you love him  right  was he actually a nice guy  because he looked tough  mike was just saying he was brutal  but he was a good guy  right  tough but great  thank you very much  thanks kelly  thank you all  greatest sports story could be number one  so a lot of people  a lot of these sports experts  sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement  i think so  yeah  they put it number one  certainly top five  in the history of our country  we have a lot of things that we've done to break records  we're going to go over them  but we've broken a lot of records now  but i want to thank that great team for being with us  very inspirational  this is a big day  the anniversary  thank you fellas  thank you  in my state of the union address  i proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great american comeback and we're just getting started  after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan democrat crusades  by the way  i think they're starting another one  did you see that  i see these phoneys  these are the do nothing democrats  they said today that putin wants to be sure that trump gets elected  here we go again  here we go again  did you see it  a story  aren't people bored  now  does that include because a couple of weeks ago  crooked hillary said chelsea gabbard  right  tulsi gabbard and right  she was a russian agent  tulsi and also stein from jill stein  i don't know jill stein  i never met the woman  she is a green party candidate or was they said she's an agent of russia  i don't know her and i don't know tulsi  the only thing i know about both of them is they're not agent  they are not agents of russia  these people are sick  that's pencil neck  pencil neck again  little pencil  no  i just see it again  i was told that was happening  i was told a week ago  they said they're trying to start a rumor  it's disinformation  that's the only thing they're good at  they're not good at anything else  they get nothing done  do nothing democrats  that putin wants to make sure get elected  listen to this  so doesn't he want to see who the democrat's going to be  wouldn't you rather have  let's say bernie  wouldn't he rather that bernie who honeymooned in moscow  wouldn't that be  these people are crazy  that's all they think about  they don't think about the country  they don't think about jobs  they don't think about lowering your drug costs  infrastructure  these people are crazy  trust me  i like what we're doing and i love this country  i love this country  now  and i campaigned on it  at the same time we want to get along with russia  we want to get along with china  we want to get along with all these countries  who the hell needs to have conflict  but these people are sick  they are sick people  the radical left's attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure  and by the way  you saw today  single best day i've ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you  because the real numbers are higher  but any poll they give you as a fake  but wisconsin  the great state of wisconsin  i was leading by many  many  many points against every one of these characters  can you believe it  we got a new one  mini mike  how did he do in the debate the other day  mini mike  here's a box mike  here mike  mini mike  he was a beauty  what happened huh  he couldn't breathe  what happened  mike would like to know how about that pocahontas screaming at him  she forgot  she forgot that she lied about her own heritage  she said she was an indian because she had high cheekbones  that was the only thing  remember what i said  i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none  right  i have none  to the best of my knowledge  wouldn't mind having some  but i happen to have none  and she choked and she went out and got a report done  one  1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means  that means probably i do have more  now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him  why  because he was gasping for breath  i can't breathe  i can't breathe  she's hitting me too hard  pocahontas  well  she won that debate cause mike could not respond  that's what they all said  they all said that  that's funny  i won  they're all shouting  it's not me that's saying it  fake news  you fake news people  no  they all said it though  who won the debate  trump  you know what  the way i look at it  when fake news cnn oops  there goes the camera off  red light just went off  see  i can tell every one of them  i know them by heart  i know the operators  i know the camera men  they're okay  they're all on our side by the way  they're screamed at  get that camera off  i don't want to do that  get that camera off  or it's going to be you job  all right  i'm sorry  precedent  but how bout msdnc  they're worse than cnn  and they're owned by people that really are bad  i think they're very bad for our country  the owners of comcast  rotten company  bad for our country  very bad  they try  they have all these pr things to try and keep their image nice and clean  what they do on television is so disgusting  i think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff  right  they can say whatever they want to say  let's see what happens over the next period of time  bunch of dishonest people  comcast  terrible company  terrible people running that company  and you know what  i had celebrity apprentice  i had the apprentice on for 14 seasons  14 seasons  and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass  please sign  please  please sign  it's an interesting story  they came and we signed  you know who signed me  jeff zucker  it's one of the only things he's done good in broadcasting  but i signed and nbc  as you know  is owned by comcast  but i signed and they figured the show would be a total failure  so they only signed me for one season  you know i was going to have it  it was go on and then the show goes  started at ten went to eight  went to seven  went to five  went to four  went to two  it went to one  i had the number one show in all of television  number one  it was a phenomenal and the final episode  remember that  with the  you remember that  do you remember the final  we had  i don't know  it was one of the biggest shows of the year  it was a tremendous success there  but here i was  i signed with nbc and they didn't even want to waste the ink on an option  usually they have an option for not  you know  just like they didn't do it  you stupid people  so they paid me very little for the first season i think  25 000 a show  which is considered not good  that's okay  it was fun  i didn't know it was going to be success  you know  hey  just like this was successful  it's a recent  because when i left and arnold schwarzenegger and i like arnold said some very nice things  so i'm not  but the show did not exactly succeed when i left  but i had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and i said  no  i'm going to run for president but i'll never forget  i looked at  i didn't know anything about this business and i had an agent  wonderful guy from william morris  and he said  sir  i don't want you to sign  no business show has ever done well on network television  well  it's not business  it's entertainment  celebrity  sir  i don't want you to sign  sir  don't sign  i said  yeah  okay  but i have a problem  i shook the hand of somebody i have to  and mark burnett was great  he was my guy and but we shook hands  so i have to  but i agreed  you know  i didn't know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television  so he said  i don't want you to sign sir  break it  i said  i can't break it  can't break it  anyway  so the show i said started at ten  went to nine  went to became  it was the number one show all of a sudden  and the agent called me up and he said  sir  i remember it was six in the morning  i was in bed  he said  sir  the show just went to number one  i'd love to see you because i think i'm entitled to more money  i said  you didn't want me to do the show  well  not really  i mean  i was okay  he said  i'd really like more money  i said  jim  i like you very much  jim  you're fired  get out  anyway  i had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful  they kept窶ｦ they would have run it  remember when they did the three hours  the whole night was the apprentice  i said  wait a minute  gone with the wind  to mention the movie a second time  gone with the wind is shorter  they had the apprentice on for three hours  i said even i think it's too long  you can't put it up for three  you got leave a little bit like i want to come back next week  but they had it on for three weeks  we did fantastically with it  comcast did great  nbc did great  they wanted me to sign for another three years  i said  no  i'm going to for president  and that was actually the time when i knew i was going to run  because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you're rich or not  it's still a lot of money  i don't care how rich you are  it's a lot  millions and millions of dollars  and i said no  i'm going to run for president  and i did that  but from the day i ran  they went from being  you know one窶ｦ but from the day i ran  they went from being wonderful  they were nice  they were nice  i guess if i didn't do well with the show they wouldn't have been nice because they weren't nice to other people that failed  people that didn't have good ratings  that business is a very simple business  if you have good ratings  you can treat them like garbage  if you have bad ratings  you can say  ""sir  i really respect you so much "" get out of here  get him out of my yard  they're very ruthless people  but comcast is a rotten company  they forgot totally  and they are worse than cnn  i will tell you that right now  comcast is worse than cnn  we should call it comcast  because that's their beautiful maiden name  comcast  they're worse than cnn  i'll  tell you something about cnn  jake tapper  today he put out窶ｦ now i know you don't like him  i know  who likes him  who the hell can like him  i think his wife likes him  actually  i really believe she does  but let me just tell you  he put out a couple of social media posts today  because i never call it tweet  i call it social media because it's much bigger than tweet  what we have  dan scavino  the great dan scavino  we have won five sites  we're number one on twitter  we're number one on facebook  and the whole world  the whole world  so it's powerful  but jake tapper put out some things  basically saying  i believe it  that's the way i read it  that the new russian thing that started yesterday  that putin wants to be sure that trump  which give me a break  give me a break  but jake tapper said it ain't so  and if he did say that because they were a little complex  they can turn them around  or when zucker sees him and said  ""why did you put that  i want that deleted and i want you to do a different one "" but he did say that  so i respect that because it's another hoax story  but we're standing up for the defense of our constitution  for our freedom  and democracy itself  you know that  i got to get that  hey  bobby  bobby  see that guy  i love that shirt  bobby  i don't know  he looks like a nice guy  can you please walk him up  even if you have about five  come here  come here  come here  come here  you got to see this shirt  you got to see this shirt  i love it  i've got to order me one that i can ride around  come on  come on up here  he looks safe  he doesn't look like he's going to start a fist fight  he's a good fan  i guess  you got to see this shirt  i love it  is there any place that's more fun than a trump rally  right  how many rallies have you been to  80  80  80  he said 80 rallies  come up here  come on  come on  come on  look at these two guys  these guys are serious  these are serious fans  right  are you with him  are you with him  are you with him  you're with him  come on  come up here  man  and look at this guy come on  thank you  fellas  wow  i just said  ""how long have you two been together "" i figured they'd say  ""we're married "" he met her at the rally in colorado  can you believe this  can you believe it  man  did he get lucky  they both got lucky  right  they both got lucky  well  that's cool  no  i just see there's so much stuff out here  it's genius  actually  while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with viral hoaxes  we've been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  enacting fair trade deals  securing our border  lifting up citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  as you heard  we added another 225 000 new jobs last month alone  way above anticipated schedule  and that makes 7 million new jobs since the election  the number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million  and remember  if i give you wrong numbers  the fake news is going to have headlines  ""trump gave you wrong窶ｦ"" i mean  it's very tough  i've got to be very careful  even if i give you wrong in the wrong way  they'll say it was wrong  i said  ""yeah  but it was wrong in the low way "" no  that's no good either  got to be very precise with these characters  the democrats don't have to be  but we have to be  we've destroyed he isis territorial caliphate 100%  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al baghdadi is dead  al baghdadi is dead  17 years  they looked for him  17 years  al-baghdadi  one of the first things i did when i came in  he's the founder of isis and when i came in three years ago  isis was all over the place  and i said  ""you got to knock it out "" we knocked it out of syria  and  iraq and other places  we really knocked at 100%  remember i wanted to leave  i said  ""all right "" we were at 96%  then 98  then 99%  i said  ""let some of these other countries do it "" wouldn't you say  right  so what happened is i wanted to leave and they said  ""no  no  no  we want 100% "" so we wait and stayed  we got 100%  then we moved them all out of syria  except we did keep the oil  you noticed that  right  we kept the oil  sorry  they said  ""he left soldiers in syria "" yeah  i did to keep the oil  if you don't mind  which is what we should have done in iraq too  by the way  i would have done that  i'm making a lot of money with all that oil  but you remember that whole thing  that whole窶ｦ i said  ""you got to find al baghdadi "" i've been saying that actually for two years  i had a lot of other things to do the first year  like fight off the democrats  these crazy democrats with their hoaxes  think of it  if they use their genius  because they are genius at that stuff  right  they're really good  they can take nothing  they can take a perfect phone call made to the ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure  he doesn't even know what's going on and they can take this perfect call  thank goodness i had a transcriber  do you agree with it  because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was  so when i released the call  when i released the transcripts  they died  they said  ""oh we got a problem "" they never thought i was going to do it  but i had no choice  i had to because i had to show they're liars  but think of it  they can take something like that  a perfect phone call  or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up  and they ended up today  front page  new york times  they used to call it the eighth column  that's the big column on the right  i don't know  the papers become so small  i don't know if they have an eighth column anymore  they used to have the eighth column  was a big deal  right  that was the big deal  today it's too narrow  think they're probably窶ｦ after i'm gone  they won't have any columns  that's why eventually they're going to support me  eventually  the times and the washington post  which will be dead as a doornail after i leave  and the cnn  it'll be an obsolete business  the cable business  msdnc will be out of business  you know  cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they're doing the highest numbers they've ever done  if an airplane goes down with 700 people  they don't cover it  if it's not trump related  they don't cover it  it's got to be trump or trump related  so if a plane goes down and it's total devastation  if the ship goes down  if the titanic- if the titanic equivalent went down  they wouldn't cover it unless i was on the sucker  it's true  they wouldn't cover it  the fake news would not cover the equivalent of the titanic  but you know what they're going to do before the election  they're going to say  ""we want to just say something  we're going to endorse the president "" you know why  because they'll be out of business  can you imagine if they had to cover mini mike  who i don't think  i think he's gone  but you know what  he'll spend another 500 million  don't forget i spent 70 and i won  of my money  in other words  they said  and this was in the new york times  i said the other night in colorado  i spent 70  mini mike so far has spent almost  500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by pocahontas  pocahontas  and she's mean  isn't she  did you see that  do you see the anger on her face  that nervous energy  she's jumping up and down  she's a mess  but no  no  she's mean  right  right  that face is just窶ｦ ""you want to get him "" she said  ""i got him  i want to see those agreements "" ""i "" ""you open up those agreements "" this poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one's a disaster  he said  ""i don't want to open those agreements  nobody told me this was going to happen "" said  ""actually  sir "" ""nobody told me  get me out of here "" after the debate  he went backstage  fired a lot of people  he said  ""how the hell did you get me into this thing "" but pocahontas was really mean  but she's going to be easy  i hope it's her  it's not going to be her  can't be  i don't think  alfred e  neuman  ladies and gentlemen  introducing president alfred e  neuman  nobody knows because you're all too young  nobody knows who alfred窶ｦ it's mad magazine  they all said窶ｦ no  howdy doody  see nobody knows who alfred e  neuman is  only the real aficionados  they're the ones and they love it  but that's only 15% of the crowd  right  am i right  better than howdy doody  howdy doody  and that's what happens when you can't get the words out  no it does  that's what happens  right  when you can't get the words out  you get angry  you get angry because you can't get the words  that might happen to me someday  can you imagine if that happened to me  man  would i be a bad guy  i'd be the meanest man in history  no  but biden is very angry  he gets angrier  and angrier  and angrier  he's changed  and then you have the tom  yeah  he said tom steyer  tom said  "" mister impeachment "" how did that work out  tom  thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing  how did that work out  this schmuck spends  250 million dollars  he ends up with one third of a percent in iowa  but maybe that could be rick  because they still don't have any idea what he got  maybe he won iowa  they took it away from him  no  but he was substantially below it  all i know  it said 1% and an arrow left  so he spends 250 million  tom steyer  never heard of this guy  who is he  where did he get his money  who is he  he was in the coal business  did you know that  this guy  this phony is a big environmentalist  he made his money  a lot of it  in the coal business  nobody knows that  but he's a fake  remember when he walked up to bernie the other day  ""hi bernie  hi "" oh  and he was having a fight with pocahontas  right  is this the greatest  mark burnett said  ""this is the greatest reality show in history "" he said  ""you can take the apprentice  and you can take survivor  and you can take every other reality show ever made  multiply it times 10 000  and you still don't have what we have  and even the cas "" he did say this  you got the perfect president  you got the perfect first lady  how about the first lady  you got the perfect kids  the kids  though  those beautiful kids  my beautiful kids  they had such a great life  before i did this  sorry  kids  sorry  my beautiful ivanka  she had such a great life  she had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell  she'd just put her name on it and she said  ""daddy  does it matter  i want to come to washington and help people get jobs "" right  ain't that true  and she left the company  and when you leave a company  all of a sudden it doesn't do as well  i wouldn't say that i exactly helped talking about the wall and other things  but she left the company  came to washington and she said 500 000 jobs  that was her goal  and she did that in the first month  she actually did  she's gotten these great companies like walmart  and many others  exxon  she's gotten them to take millions of people  she's now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies  it's incredible  15 million  and she's smart  she got it figured out  but most people can't  but she does  but all they do is give them heat  they work so hard  and could you imagine you take biden's son  can you imagine  but you know what  we don't do any of that stuff  we don't do that stuff  we don't do it  the kid got  3 million dollars  83 000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president  and speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television  because it's the greatest show of all time  right  look at us  look  we told you  what  last night  little change here  folks  we're going to move it up from eight o'clock in the evening until 12 o'clock in the afternoon  little change  just a minor change  because i have to get back to washington to work  i feel guilty  this is too much fun  but speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents  if you become president  the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible  horrible vice president  so if the idiots ever want to impeach you  they have to say  i can't impeach him  look who we have  i have the perfect vice president  i have the greatest in the world  i have the greatest vice president  i don't know  i got the great ones  i said  ""i can't do that "" i picked a great guy  he's done a fantastic job  he's been a great vice president  but it is true  i could have picked  i'll give you names  but don't want to do that because i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings  but there are plenty of them out there  they're mostly out there and i don't want to do that  but mike pence has been great  but tell me  is it perfect casting the whole thing  and this isn't about casting  this is about real life  but when mark burnett said to me the other day  he said  ""the greatest reality show of all times  times of million "" that's exactly except for one thing  we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before  right  right  so  we took out al baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the world's top terrorist  qasem soleimani of iran  ending his evil reign of terror forever  he's the father of the roadside bomb  when you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs  they're walking  and trying to walk so hard  and they're really in rough shape he's the father of the窶ｦ he loved the roadside bomb  he thought it was a great thing  where is he now  soleimani  and i'll tell you what  you know who's happy about it  the people of iran are happy and even the leaders of iran  because the leaders of iran were afraid of him  okay  and the fact is  america is respected again  we're winning  we're winning all over  we're winning in washington that democrats keep losing their minds  that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement  look  we're a unified party  the republican party has never been unified like it is today  i'll show you  i could say  ""we're going to go over to the hill  no  we're going to go over to someplace and we're going to do a rally at eight o'clock tonight "" we'd have tens of thousands of people there  there's never been this  ronald reagan was great  i thought he was a great guy  great president  didn't like his policy on trade  that's okay  trade  but if he came to las vegas  you know they'd have a ballroom  and they'd have 500  maybe a thousand people  what we're doing窶ｦ and this isn't even  i must say this  i don't want to tell you this  this is not election season  because we're nine months away  election season is when you're two months away  we're not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now  believe it or not  then we had even before the election in 2016  it's true  it's too early  it's too early  it's true  we have a great gentleman and a woman with us  a friend of mine  mister and misses sheldon adelson  right over here  great  great person  two great people  he's got so much money  he doesn't know what the hell to do with it  he owns the sands hotel  that's like one of the smaller businesses  sheldon  that's like your small business  right  he is a great guy  she's an incredible  she's a doctor  and she studies addiction  and drugs  drug addiction  all sorts of addictions  and she knows more about that subject  i think  than anybody  and she works hard and she doesn't need it  he does not need the money that she brings in  okay  he also happens on the paper  he owns the paper  you own the paper in town  right  they wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much  you said  ""give it to them  it's peanuts  what the hell difference does it make  we want to thank the adelsons  they've been incredible fans and they love israel  they love israel  i just saw him sitting there  i didn't know they were here  i just see him sitting there  he's something  the chairman of the nevada republican party  who's really been great  he's been with me for a long time and he's a very committed man  make america great again  oh  oh  oh  let's do a poll quick  just quick  i'll never get rid of maga because i'm superstitious  but we just hit an all time high with the stock market  our military is rebuilt  you just got the greatest tax cuts in history  the greatest rate  regulation cuts  and all this stuff  so  let me ask you this  so  ""make america great again "" it sort of doesn't work quite as well  so now we have keep america great and we have the new hat  it's higher  stiff  it's like a billboard  right  i call it the billboard  it's a billboard  so let's go just that  because i am very surprised by it  we're going to keep them both  but i just curious if we did go to one  ""make america great again "" "" keep america great "" i can't  i would have said that's impossible  ""make america great again "" is the greatest phrase  a lot of people  again  fake news  i think will agree to it  it's the greatest phrase ever used in politics  it's the greatest phrase  now  who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say  ""oh  let's go with a new phrase "" right  but we're going to keep it  so we have to keep maga  but now we have cag  now we have cag  so we have a both  i just don't have the courage to get rid of the one  it would be too disrespectful  too disrespectful  but michael mcdonald  i want to thank you and the members of the nevada republican central committee  you're all here  they're great people  and the man came here  he loves us  he's been with us  rick harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop  rick harrison  you better win  michael  otherwise  that's the last time i'm introducing you like that  i hear we're up  i hear we're doing nicely  i hear we're doing great  and by the way  the union  i have a lot of respect for that union  last time  i had a strike in my building during the election  it's the only reason we would have won this state  brilliantly to save three cents  i could have settled the strike before the election  i wanted to save  2 total  and he wasn't too good  he didn't do too good  but we almost won this state despite窶ｦ i had a big strike  had thousands and thousands of union guys  they had it  look  they wanted  wanted to show us  but i think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us  they're teamsters  so many of the unions  because i'm for the working man and woman  whether you're union or non-union  some states are all union  some states are no union  but we get them all  and i think we're going to have tremendous success  and a lot of the democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have  the unions have worked hard on healthcare and they're going to ruin them  they're going to take away窶ｦ well  we're going to窶ｦ you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare  so we'll see what happens  but a lot of the democrats want to do that  they think it's wonderful  but together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society  that's true  since my election  over 125- that's true  since my election  over 125 000 new jobs have been created right here in nevada  including over 40 000 new nevada manufacturing and construction jobs  a 30% increase  the national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century  and soon we're going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others  the average unemployment rate for my administration  this is the coolest of them all  is the lowest for any united states president in recorded history  that's pretty good  when i'm in a debate  they're saying  ""we're going to do this "" i say  ""listen  we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country "" african american unemployment  hispanic american  hispanic  we got a lot of hispanic  i love hispanic  who in this audience is hispanic  yeah  we're doing great  well  we should be doing great  you have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded  asian americans  likewise the lowest ever recorded  the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years  african american youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low  people i love  people i might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability  the veteran's unemployment rate drop to the lowest record  lowest in history  the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they're back there checking every word  they're going "" oh  my god  he's right "" i can't say it because i got all these maniacs back there  they're trying to find窶ｦ ""he put the comma in the wrong place  he didn't make that word plural  therefore he lied "" now i've got to be very accurate because all these numbers  they check them out  ""they're in there  checking them out  check on the african american unemployment  please "" please tell me it's not historic  these people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth  not all of them  workers without a high school diploma  we have millions of people that didn't go through high school  they left  they had problems  good problems  bad problems  families where they don't have the money  they didn't get a high school diploma  they've achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the united states  those are important groups of people  half a million more hispanic americans now own a home  now  hispanic have done so good  and by the way  you know who understands the border  because we are building that wall like crazy  remember  they also said  ""if you build the wall you'll lose the hispanic vote "" i said  ""i got to do what's right  you know who understands the border better than anybody  you know who understands crime at the border better than anybody  the hispanics understand it and they don't want to be working and have people come and take their job  have people come in where they can't pay for their house  have people come in who are very bad people "" you have some very bad people  you have murderers and rapists  and we have set all sorts of records at the border  but we're up to 122 miles of wall  and it is true  the people that understand it the best are hispanic  so  thank you  we got to make our country safe  we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare  median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country  think of that  i say it all the time  president bush  eight years   450  president barack hussein obama  eight years    975  president donald john trump  three years  it's actually less when they did the numbers  three years  including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts  three years  so  you had 450  975  that's eight and eight  now we're down to three years  a little less  three years    10 000 per family a year  10 000 a year  our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats  i deal with them  they're not good  it's called the swamp  we've ended the war on american energy  lowering utility bills  reducing prices at the pump  reducing your prices  part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric  i also recently took action on an issue nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years  yucca mountain  you know yucca mountain  my budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at yucca mountain  so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives  why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard  i won't say which countries  but you know what other countries do  i will not say which ones  they put it on a ship  they float it out into the middle of the ocean  they find a nice deep spot and they dump it  that's the end of it  but we would never do that for environmental reasons  we are reversing decades so yucca mountain窶ｦ you're okay  please  okay  just relax  sheldon  do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write  yucca mountain  please  he'll call up  ""yucca mountain is okay "" that's the end of that  so yucca mountain  you're in great shape  maybe they can finally report it properly  but we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies  for years  washington politicians took money from lobbyists  global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth  they stole our wealth  they shipped it overseas and to other countries  america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto  the world trade organization  probably an even worse deal for us than nafta  if that's possible  but under my administration  the great betrayal of america is over  america is no longer for sale  last month we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new u s  mexico  canada agreement usmca  see  we played the song ymca because that's the only way you'll remember  just think of the song ymca  think of the song and you'll remember that usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers  ranchers  and manufacturers all across the great state of nevada  i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of america jobs  our strategy worked  last month  we signed a ground breaking trade agreement  probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with china that will defend our workers  protect our intellectual property and boost american exports by a lot  china will be buying  250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers  my guys wanted 16  i said  ""make it 50 "" my guys wanted 16  they got china up to 20  i said  ""nope  got to make it 50 "" and then i said to china  ""you got a billion and a half people  what difference does it make "" they said  ""you're right "" 50 billion  i don't think our farmers can produce that much  but we're going to soon find out  they're going to buy very large tractors  after years of building up other countries  we are finally rebuilding our country  we are finally putting america first  or no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration  before i came into office  the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country  poisoning our children  including right here in a very big way  the great state of nevada  washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens  you know that  you've been complaining about it for a long time  it's one of the reasons you voted for trump  they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare  of healthcare  of lots of other things  including education  all paid for by the taxpayers of the united states  illegal immigration costs nevada taxpayers  think of it  more than  1 6 billion every year  over  1 500 per household  for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants  we could rebuild every city  all of these distressed areas in the united states  throughout our country  the money spend  it's not even thinkable and don't forget when we say come  like in california the clown  he says  ""come  we'll give you free healthcare "" people that weren't even thinking about coming  that's why we have caravans of people that we're turning back  mexico's been great  by the way  they gave us 27 000 soldiers on our border  but when a governor  nice guy actually  he's a nice guy  we just got to explain the facts of life  he's a nice guy  oh doctor  please  doctor in the house  please  medical  please  a doctor  thank you  take your time  we've got plenty of time  yeah  take your time please  a lot of these people have been here for three days  it's a lot  those front row people are tough  take your time  doc  thank you  everybody  thank you  doctor  that's true  they get here so窶ｦ they stand and sit and sometimes days early  in colorado  they're there three  four days early  it's tough  and we work it and make sure that you have everything you want  number one  we cover the facts and number two  we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time  but things like that happen a lot because after two  three days  it's not easy and these are strong people  i'm not going to fight any of them  okay  now  amazing people  thank you very much  under my administration  we're finally taking care of our own citizens first  including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws  pay their taxes  lift up our society  and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities  every day  democrats' open border policies are harming and killing innocent people  you know what's happening  you know what's going on  in this region alone last year  ice officers  and they're patriots  they're strong  tough patriots  if we didn't have them  they remove thousands and thousands of ms13 gang members a year and plenty of others  who else is going to do it  ice officers arrested over 5  000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses  including robbery  rape  and even murder  many murders  in western nevada  an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year  right here in las vegas  three ms13 gang members abducted a man  tied him up with his shoelaces  shot him repeatedly  and hacked him to death with a machete  you know exactly what i'm talking about  it's right here in your place  in las vegas  right here  tied up and hacked him to death  yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens  even convicted criminals and murderers  and they support deadly sanctuary cities  i say this all the time and i just窶ｦ how the hell  where are they coming from  i don't get it right  seriously  i don't get it  sanctuary cities imperil american lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities  if you want to shut down sanctuary cities  if you want to protect your family and your loved ones  you must vote republican in 2020  and you have some great ones here  michael  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row  and as the wall gets longer  it gets easier and easier  remember when the democrats were saying  ""you don't need a wall "" two things that never change  right  all these computers  they said  ""use drones "" oh great  we'll fly over with drones  watch the people pour in by the thousands  that's great  use drones  before i came along  they all wanted a wall  they just didn't know how to build it  they had no clue  they had the money  they actually gave the money back  but they had no clue  but as soon as i came in and i said  ""wall "" they went against and i made a terrible mistake  we catch them  you know the story  they come over  could be a killer  murderer  rapist  they come over  we can't do anything  we have to be politically correct  we catch them  we then say  ""what's your address "" they don't know  they don't even know their country in many cases  where do you come from  we don't know and they mean it  but some are very serious criminals  so  we catch them  we take whatever they can take  which is nothing  and then we had to release them in our country  we can't bring them back  and then we have a system of judges  thousands of judges all over the place  you got to be like perry mason and every illegal that comes in  they have the lawyers  the lawyers meet them  they get paid fees  but we're breaking the system  no more catch and release  you think that was easy  and the big thing is that 30 foot窶ｦ and this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol  totally  and border patrol has seized the largest amount  just recently  of deadly narcotics ever recorded  the largest amount  we've deported record numbers of gang members  we've done more to secure the border than any administration in history  we are  as i said  building the wall faster than ever  faster and bigger than anyone thought possible  they can't believe we're getting it done  we'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year  500 miles  washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now  132 congressional democrats have now signed up for bernie sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million americans  many of them in this room  of their private coverage  remember president obama  remember  he said  ""you can keep your doctor  you can keep your plan "" 28 times  he lied  so we should impeach him  we're going to impeach him  we'll do a belated impeachment  28 times  ""you can keep your doctor "" right  remember  you could keep your doctor  unfortunately  when they found out you can't keep your doctor  he said  ""i was just kidding "" now  we should impeach him  we'll do a belated impeachment  fake news  you have it  see  you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do  they go back and they write  president trump said that obama should be impeached  but he's not in office and so therefore they can't impeach  he doesn't know what he's talking about because he's not in office  so therefore they can't  so  you have to be very careful  that's why i use the word belated impeachment  belated  meaning i'm just kidding  okay  they do it all the time  they had it the other day  i said  ""bring back gone with the wind "" right  i said a little bit up here  but i said the movie the other day in colorado  i guess  i said  ""huh  south korean movie won "" they said  ""ladies and gentlemen  the winner of the academy award is 窶ｦ"" a movie made in south korea  what's this all about  and i deal with them  they like me  we're helping them a lot  they're killing us on trade  they beat us on trade and then they win the academy award for a fricking movie  but we redid that trade deal  but the other day they got me on this one too  i said  ""whatever happened to gone with the wind  that beautiful movie  vivian lee  clark gable  right  whatever happened  bring back gone with the wind "" and some of them wrote  ""he doesn't know that that movie was made in 1936 "" he says fake news  it is fake news  they're fakers  but now  anybody sitting there reading this saying  ""man  trump  can't be that smart  he said bring back gone with the wind  that's an old movie "" yeah  it's an old classic  what i say is make great movies  not this computerized garbage  and i was never a fan of brad pitt  i will tell you that  no  i thought he was a stiff  he was a stiff  it's like a boring guy  all of a sudden he wins the academy award  so fitting  their ratings aren't so good at the academy awards  you know when that stopped  when they started attacking us  their ratings went right down the tubers  i told somebody  the evening newscasts  they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked  they're absolutely dishonest  i said to one of the big broadcasters  i'm friendly with him  i said  ""if you ever did a conservative newscasts  instead of窶ｦ you got  abc is terrible  nbc is just absolutely atrocious "" and they do badly  not a lot of people are watching  they used to  when we had the late  great walter cronkite and these legends  right  but abc is terrible and nbc is terrible and cbs is terrible  they're all the same  and i said  ""your ratings stink  if you would do a newscast that's conservative  i'd get them a host  i could recommend guys right now  right  i'd get them a host  we'll call up窶ｦ don't take sean hannity away from us  don't take our show  that's my problem  i don't want to take away any of our people  you get a pete hegseth  you get a jesse waters  you get窶ｦ i could name so many of them  right  and you put them on that broadcast  their ratings would go up five fold but they don't know that  i don't know  they're stupid  their ratings would go through the roof  but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times  they would rather have a fail窶ｦ seven months ago we had a little skit  and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money  or big parts of it  and have a really horrible market on the basis that we  not me  we could not be elected on november 3rd  this is how crazy- 窶ｦ on november 3rd  this is how evil  this is how crazy they are  they've gone crazy  i guess you call it trump derangement syndrome  but if they ever did a conservative broadcast  meaning very fair  very honest when i say that  it's almost like do a fair broadcast  just a fair broadcast  that thing would be the hottest show  but they don't realize it  and if they do  they probably wouldn't do it anyway because they don't want to go away from what they're doing  which is crazy because it is  they're doing very poorly  while the social and socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare and your social security  they're putting it at risk  my administration is protecting your social security  remember they said  four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman  i mean  i hate to mention her name  i did it you know  yesterday  i threw all the runs  hates it  she's a zero  it's got zero television personality  aero ab stoddard  whoever that is  she said  ""donald trump lost all of his debates "" i won every debate and maybe  i don't know maybe one somebody  but i won with tremendous numbers  he says  ""you always won "" i'm not sure  we try  i'll tell you that and we're winning now  but this crazy woman who's got zero going  zero  she said  ""donald trump lost his debates that he won "" you know  she was talking about how badly benny mike did  so she said  ""well  donald trump "" no  i won every single debate  i won them against crooked hillary  i won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates  and for some reason  you know  sometimes you do say  it's not a big deal  nobody watches it  nobody cares  nobody even knows who she is  i just made her famous  right  she's nothing  she's nothing  she's got no talent  got nothing  she's probably got a little drive  that's how she keeps getting on television  other people don't have her drive  but you know what  i said  ""that's really unfair "" so i took out the polls  time magazine  drudge  good guy  drudge  drudge  we took out a lot of different things and we put up the drudge poll  the time magazine and many others  and some of them had to be down to like at 91% and they didn't have many people and i can't really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine  some of them are great republican senators  i'm not going to show results  but i'm holding it up just quickly glancing  i call it a glancing blow  but we won the debates and i have this fake news person saying  ""donald trump did very poorly in the debates "" i want every debate easily  i never did it before  remember my first question  i said  ""rosie o'donnell "" that was one of my best answers  rosie o'donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody i've ever seen and nothing happens to her  right  and yet 窶亘evich violate 窶ｦ he made a little mistake and they want to destroy him  so we pardoned him  we pardoned him  by the way  he made a mistake  rosie o'donnell  that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but dinesh  dinesh  they wanted to put him in jail  i don't know  i think he might've even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable  rosie o'donnell  five times what she did is incredible  nothing happens  and then she gets on and says  what a bad guy i am  i'm not a bad guy  but it's really a disgrace  you know  it's a disgrace  i'm glad they didn't do anything with it  frankly because you know what to do for something like that  but you know what  we have two sets of justices in this country  it's no good  it's no good  it's no good  you know the thing we're working on right now  we're trying to get fairness for a certain person who's been treated very unfairly  a man who had a juror  who was a radical anti-trump person  and she didn't say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things  and you know how they caught her  when he was convicted and then a statement was made  she started jumping up and down screaming  "" yes  yes "" and started telling everybody  they said  ""wait a minute  wasn't she just a juror "" the woman was totally biased  how do you do this  so i fight  look  i fight  a lot of times it's not worth it  but i got to fight for fairness  i got to fight for fairness  got to fight for fairness  it's a very unfair system  i guess it's called the swamp  when i said drain the swamp  it was a nice phrase  i never liked the phrase  when i was campaigning  somehow the phrase came up  ""sir  i think we have a phrase  drain the swamp "" i said  ""i don't like it  that's too hokey "" but one day i was in a big arena  25 000 people packed before the election and i said  ""and we will drain the swamp "" the place went crazy  i said  ""wow  you never know  you never know "" frank sinatra said his best song  i won't tell you which one because i'll ruin it for you  but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it  the song that he liked the least  but he said that's the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know  so i said  ""drain the swamp "" and the people went crazy  i said  ""woah "" i said  ""let's try that again "" and the next time i did it again and again and again  i only didn't know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp  so my administration is protecting your social security  your medicare  and is fighting to give you great healthcare  we're defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan  we're defending that right  you're going to have that right back  we're going to cancel that obamacare if we could win the case and we're going to give you great healthcare and we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office  we're managing it very well  we got rid of the individual mandate  by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare  right  we got rid of it  and it was upheld in the supreme court  what we did  whenever we get sued  everything we do  if we move  if we take 10 steps right or left  we get sued and we're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive  we're going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign  we're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will  that's why if we are successful  you don't want the supreme court to try and get rid of this  the caucus  it's a caucus known as obamacare  but we're running it much better than they did  remember when they had  this was the greatest  the  5 billion website  right  5 billion  it was supposed to cost 5 million  i have a son at home  he's 13  he's a genius with computers  ""hi  dad  what's up  dead dad  get out of here "" hey listen  i'm the president of the united states  pal  don't talk to your dad  ""dad  come on dad  can't you see i'm playing with my computer "" the guy talks to me and he's working with his computer  these guys are genius  you know  they grow up with like walking  right  but he's looking at me  i could have given him their healthcare site  he would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have  so remember  come on  dad  i'm busy  dad  what do you want  what do you want  dad  barron  woah  wow  he's going to like that  he's a good boy  he's a tall boy  i'll tell you that  just turned 13  he's up there  i'm saying  ""hi barron  how are you doing "" but they're great with the computers  they spent 5 billion  okay  it was going to cost 50  it was going to cost five  it was going to cost 50  then it was going to   what was the final number  five hundreds  the number that they spent   5 billion  right  it still doesn't work  they spent  5 billion  right  and they spent  500 million on all of the problems it caused and we've really straightened it out  but it's still lousy healthcare  obamacare  and it's really not obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate  it's no longer obamacare but we're going to terminate it  we're going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise i won't do it  we're going to give you brand new preexisting and we're going to have a great healthcare that's much less expensive  and we're fighting to stop surprise medical bill and barron's is going to be very happy  i signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices  those same prices fall very fast  you know  a man that does this very professionally is great  into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it  but you know it was just a very strong statement  but he said  ""sir  price transparency in hospitals  where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices  right now you can't see  if you go to a hospital  they won't even tell you how much it's going to cost  they operate and then they'll give you a bill and you'll say  ""oh my god  i had no idea it could be "" they take blood  we have one person  blood  39  another place  the exact same thing   2500  take blood  a blood test  one is  39 one  is  2500  the same test  maybe the  39 test is better  who the hell knows  but it's crazy  price transparency and he looks at me  he goes  and he's a real pro  one of the top in the country  he said  ""sir "" and nobody wanted to do it because it's a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don't exactly love it  the hospitals don't love it  but i got to do what's right for you  the people  i don't care  i'm not  i got to do it  but he looked at me  and this is why i did it  it was one phrase  you know  do you ever do where you're not going to do something  and then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase  he said  ""sir  price transparency is bigger than healthcare "" i said  ""what do you mean by that "" he said  ""you will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare  hospitals  doctors "" he said  ""you'll be able to price out everything  you'll be able to see costs "" he said  ""price transparency "" you know  people you've heard about this for 15  20 years  no president has the guts to do it  probably means i won't get campaign contributions from certain people  but i'm not going to get them anyway  what the hell difference does that make  i don't want them  i don't want them  i got to do what's right  you know  we're here for a short period of time  even if it's a long period  it's still a short period and we've got to do so  price transparency is a big deal  he said it's bigger than healthcare  think of that  bigger than healthcare  so let's see what happens  but that'll kick in  unfortunately  that kicks in after the election because we're going through the final stages  we going through a statutory process  unfortunately  so think of it  we're going to win  but let's say the fake news could give me enough phony stories  enough bad stuff that we don't make it  the new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won't even know what the hell it is  and i took the heat  isn't that something  but we're going to win  we got to win for that reason alone  we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs  which are just as good as the name brand drugs  but a fraction of the cost  and that was another one  tremendous political pressure  think of it  you own bayer aspirin  you own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money  and then the guy comes along said  ""i want to make 20 forms of aspirin "" they're exactly the same  exactly  but they don't have a big name on it  exactly as good  i don't say better  i don't say worse  they're exactly the same  you know  people still  they want to go out and buy the name  you know  i do  i do  you know  because it's just because we're stupid  no  it's true  they're exactly the same  we're approving so many of the generic drugs  a record number  nobody's ever approved so much  the drug companies hate it  they hate it  never happened like what we're doing  we also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years  they'd have a new drug  the thing was obsolete by the time it got approved  we've passed a really spectacular thing that they've been trying to get for 40 some odd years  right to try  so you don't have to now go if you get  hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems  right to try  and so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything  it's great  if you're terminally ill  if you're very  very sick  you're not going to make it  and you know why they didn't do it  they wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to be sued  and they said  ""no  this could be dangerous "" they said  ""the people are terminally ill  they're going to die  let them use the experimental drugs  don't wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market "" and it turned out we are having such unbelievable results  and you know what else  some of those drug companies are now like it  that they fought me like crazy because it's really showing if it works there  it's really showing that it works  it's pretty amazing  right to try and this is really something  brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating alzheimer's disease  we've made a lot of progress  we've made a lot of progress  sheldon and we're pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients  our babies  and breaking all records in so doing  all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth  this is why in my state of the union address  did you like it  good  it's a different kind of address  you know  we can go lots of different ways  right  presidential  not presidential  i was presidential  totally  you'd have about three people standing here  but i asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  the democrat party is the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  blatant corruption  and the total obliteration of your very  very important second amendment  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and the late great abraham lincoln  which everybody forgot  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background  every community  and every single walk of life  we are the party of boundless optimism  excitement  energy  and enthusiasm  we are wealthy  right  are we enthusiastic  you know how many of these i've done in the last four days  people say  ""where the hell do you get your energy "" i say  ""well  the truth is i like what i do and if we weren't getting the results  i wouldn't like it "" if we weren't getting the results  if i didn't see the results  i wouldn't like it at all  we're welcoming americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make america great again  we're a very big party  we are the party of big ideas for the future  republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school  i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life  was never going to happen  we got it done  this could not have been done by anyone but the republican party and ourselves  you know the democrats have tried for years  they couldn't get it done  we got it done  to uphold the rule of law  we are confirmed and this is something they say  most important thing you can do  judges  i say most important thing is defense  second is judges  a record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written  and we have appointed two great new supreme court justices  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  we have invested  2 2 trillion to rebuild the united states military  including more than  130 million for nellis air force base right here  and we just created the sixth branch of the american armed forces  the space force  72 years  72 years  the air force was 72 years ago  we just did a branch  it's a big deal  isn't it  think of it  a branch  the army  the air force  think of it  we did a branch  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of nevada  at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020 november 3rd  november 3rd  only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane and lawful system of immigration  we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase  ""made in the usa "" we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic within nine years in america  and we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on mars  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and that is under siege in case you haven't noticed  you know  your second amendment is under siege  just don't worry  long as i'm here  they're not touching it  above all  we will never stop fighting for this  so true  but we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes and they are heroes  we love them  of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto  in god we trust  from carson city to reno to right here in las vegas  we stand on the shoulders of red blooded american patriots who poured out their heart  sweat  and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our great  beautiful  lovely freedom  freedom  freedom  freedom  nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors  miners and cowboys who tamed the frontier  raised the mighty hoover dam  that's a beauty  transformed the barren desert into a shining oasis  lit up the lights of the las vegas strip and help to make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth  and we are making it greater than ever before  proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are one movement  one people  one family and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  and ladies and gentlemen of nevada  the best is yet to come together  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america

15,3,Sep,2020,datasets/Latrobe,"so thank you pennsylvania  very much  i'm thrilled to be in latrobe  the home of the late  great  my friend  arnold palmer  what a great guy he was  what a great guy  thank you very much  61 days from now  we're going to win the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and we are going to win four more years in the white house  joe biden wants to surrender your jobs to china  you know that  his son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing  he wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob  he's trying to change now  we say that's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water  and before the china virus  this election was over  now i had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it  we don't get the credit  we don't get the credit  we made a lot of governors look very good  but i will keep your jobs in america  and i'll bring rioters  looters  violent extremists  anarchists  we will bring them to justice  that's what we're doing right now  we have over 400 right now under arrest  these are bad people  over the last three and a half years  we've secured america's borders  fixed our broken trade deals  rebuilt the united states military  obliterated the isis caliphate 100%  secured american energy independence  and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world  and now we're going to do it again  have to do it again  have to do it again  got to do it again  and it's happening  you see what's happening  job numbers  retail sale numbers  they're all at records  it's happening  it's happening very fast  it's actually happening in a super v  not a v  it's a super v and you'll see that  and big numbers are coming out and have come out  and just watch your set or watch your newspaper  read your newspaper  you're seeing numbers that  congressmen  we haven't seen those numbers ever before  actually  we've never seen them  and by the way  we have record stock markets  we have record everything  you're going to have an incredible economic year next year  your stocks are going up  your 401s are through the roof  i had a little pause today  people wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way  but the stock market's at record levels  think of it  in the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic  we're rounding that turn  and vaccines are coming along great  the job that they've done  the doctors  everybody else  we're years ahead of schedule  anybody else's president  you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now  i'll tell you right now  that i can tell you  biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family  he is a puppet of the socialists  marxists  and the cop hating extremists  and they are cop hating  and we love our law enforcement  we love our law enforcement  and by the way  i don't know if you saw this  if there's any way of you seeing it  we have thousands of people behind this hangar  thousands  and we're trying to get them in  and i'd love to get them in  i mean  it's an airport  let them go to the runways  okay  let them in  i mean  literally there  we landed  i actually thought that was the crowd  we're doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while  a little while  but in certain ways  i like this better  i don't have to travel  i get off the plane  i make a speech  i get the hell out of here  no  these are great  do you remember the last days before the campaign  i'd do a lot of them a day  get off that plane  it was a little different plane  it was black and white instead of the blue and white  but we had some time  and that was an important day and that was an important year  2016  but i will tell you  the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country  and we had a level of enthusiasm  i mean  even look today  with all going on  look at the kind of crowds we have  but we had record enthusiasm in 2016  by the way  was that greatest evening ever  november  and now it's going to be november 3rd  and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree  you move that tree  it takes a little while to plant  your tax cuts  they're going to raise your taxes  they're going to take away your guns  really  if you look  and you know  they'll criticize me for saying this  the fake news media  which is back there  with their fake polls  the same as last year  we could just put it all on tape  the fake polls  the fake everything  you know  they're called suppression polls  they're meant to make you depressed  are you depressed  you don't look depressed  we have the real numbers  we're leading everywhere  we are leading everywhere  i'll tell you  i think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago  and there's far more enthusiasm  our base is bigger  it's stronger  and we've done the greatest job  again  if we didn't get hit by the plague from china  between us  i would have canceled  mr  congressman  most of the rallies  i wouldn't have needed a rally  that's a little bit unfair  but that's okay  that's what china's done to our nation  they've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways  never has anybody ripped off our nation like china  and i've taken in billions and billions of dollars  we never took in 25 cents from china  and i gave  28 billion  right   28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by china  and our farmers are very unhappy  i don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful pennsylvania town  i know we have a lot of boilermakers over there  we got a lot of boilermakers  i'll be talking about them  look at those guys  nobody going to mess with them  i'll tell you  we're going to be talking about them in a minute  but for the entire summer  biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in democrat run cities all  burned down businesses  terrorized civilians  and just recently marched through the streets chanting  ""death to america "" this is what we have  death to america  and by the way  we could end it like immediately  you saw what we did in wisconsin  it ended  it took a while for the governor  you know  they have to ask us in  it's like  otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary  the national guard is fantastic  i went to see them two days ago  biden went there today  there was nobody there  there was nobody there  he was a little late  i was going to say  ""hey  listen  we ended that problem "" but we could end it in portland  wise guys in portland  anarchists  they're agitators  they're looters  i'll tell you we could end it in portland in a half an hour  we did it in seattle  we told them we're coming in  you either end it or were coming in  congressman  we were going in the next day  we were all set  i was actually disappointed  to be honest  they ended it in seattle  they took over 20% of the city  do you believe this  and the mayor said  ""no  it's going to be a summer of love "" these people are crazy  so we end them very quickly  we end them very quickly  and now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing  where they allow crime to run rampant  and we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue  i took out an old ordinance  a very old one  because today in congress  you don't get things like that today  they think that you should just have no cash bail  they do the no cash bail  you kill somebody  there's no bail  don't worry about it  go out  but i took out an old ordinance  i gave a new executive order  it says 10 years in prison  and amazingly  amazingly  that was three and a half months ago  and they were having a big march on washington  march elsewhere  and amazingly  that was the end of the statues coming down  no statutes  and we're actually prosecuting people for having done it  we made it retroactive to the beginning  terrible  terrible  and by the way  the state statues and monuments  they have to do the same thing  it's real easy  but the rioters that want biden to win  they want him to win because their agenda  it's what they want  it's the craziest thing i've ever seen  they both want to cut funding for police  they want to end that cash bail  they want to hire far left prosecutors and judges  and let the criminals run wild  the radical left district attorney in portland  mike schmidt  his name is  has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers  disorderly conduct  criminal trespass  rioting  and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance  oh  it's worse  it's worse  you have somebody in philadelphia who's worse  right  worse  in his manifesto with bernie sanders  that's what it is  biden agreed to all these things  you notice now  ""no  no  i never said about fracking  i never said "" if you don't do fracking in pennsylvania  900 000 jobs and your energy bills will triple  other than that  i don't think you should have it  okay  no  but he said in the manifesto  plus he said many times  we put on the clip yesterday where he  no fracking  no this  no that  i mean  no guns  how about guns  no guns  no second amendment  biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide  that's what he's done  that's called the manifesto  he agreed to all this stuff  the craziest thing  you're supposed to bring it to the right  he actually brought it further left  bernie never dreamt that this was possible  crazy bernie  do you know crazy bernie  i had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago  a big percentage  you know why  because i agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing  trade  the trade  because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did i  nobody else got it  especially biden never got it  he never got it  still doesn't get it  now he really gets nothing  i tell you  he didn't get it in prime time  now he really doesn't get it  but it's okay for them to make every city look just like portland which is a disaster  and again  we could clean it up  we just go right through it  5 000  10 000  right through it  these guys are tough  they're smart  and they love our country  they love our country  we'll clean it up in one half hour  it'll be over   strength  they don't understand  nice  they chased him out of his home  unbelievable  biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist  and my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them  and i will always defend law abiding citizens  that's why the rioters are voting for biden and the law enforcement people  you know  we have it from everybody  we just got the sheriffs in florida  all of them  all of them  we got ohio  we got texas  we got north carolina  we got south carolina  we got everybody  i see rick perry right there  rick perry  what are you doing here  rick  rick perry  one of the greats  but they're all voting for me  this election is about safety and this election is about jobs  today  i'm delighted to accept a very  very special endorsement from people i like  sort of grew up with these people  i don't know what it is  the relationship we have with all of us  with all of us  what i'm endorsing  i'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very  very special people  they work hard  they do great  we really put them back to work because this state was in trouble  at last year  you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation  right  of your whole operation  you've never had anything like that  this has been your greatest  this has been prior to the plague coming in  it's been the commonwealth's greatest  can we ever call the commonwealth a state  you have two places  but you always have to say  well  wait a minute  is this one a commonwealth  two places  you know what the other place is  name it  huh  that's right  how did you know that  congressmen  huh  but this commonwealth  it's a great commonwealth  it's a great place  and the boilermakers  local union  it's local 154 of the boilermakers  they chartered in pittsburgh 125 years ago  none of you were around to see it  and it now represents members in pennsylvania  ohio  and west virginia  and i want to thank john hughes and the boilermakers here today  it's a great honor to have you  where's john  where the hell is john  stand up  john  john  we appreciate it  we appreciate it  do you know why john is the head  you know why  because look  he's got the worst location  i say  ""where's john "" i'm looking in the front row  put up your hand  john  look at that guy  he's great  you've got my vote  john  hey  boilermakers  thank you  what a job you do  you're the heart of this country  you really are  thank you very much  that's a great endorsement  that's a great endorsement  joe biden spent the last 47 years shipping pennsylvania jobs to china and foreign nations  and i've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home  bringing a lot of things back home  i ended the last administration's eight year pure war on pennsylvania oil  and coal  and fracking  if you look at the natural gas  what they've done to this state  what they were doing to this state  it was sort of easy  i just opened it up and i said  ""do it "" and the investment put into pennsylvania  the investment put into the commonwealth of pennsylvania has been record setting  but again  you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus  you're going to be set  now with what we're doing  i believe that this next quarter  which will be announced  interestingly  just prior to the election  so i'm putting myself on the line  but i know what's going to happen  the numbers are going to be great  and next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for pennsylvania  but for the entire country  so joe hiden  we have a new one  joe hiden  we call him joe hiden  i have all  what do you like better  what do you like better  we got a number  let's do a little poll  can we do a poll  i saved myself so much money  you know  i saved myself so much money  we do these polls with thousands  and those people are coming in from the back  are they not  yes  they're coming in  i'm telling you wouldn't have believed it  i'm landing  i wasn't waving at you  i was waving at them  there's more  but i do these polls  right  and it's like a perfect poll  do you ever see the companies  you give them a million bucks and they do a poll  like 78 people were polled  now you've got thousands of people  so tell me  what's your feeling  first of all in the name you like maga  make america great again  yes  oh  you are the one  you are a man  i made you famous today  you said the nicest things about me  thank you  did you see him on television today  i think you're great  i think you're great  thank you  no  he called me a great christian and a great christian leader  thank you  but he did say i wasn't perfect  but that's okay  i said thank you  anyway  right  no  that was really great  that was really great  biden- no that was really great  that was really great  but if you look at it  the things they've done  we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because i love the people saying do this or do that  but one of the things i got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad  it's a rip off of our country  the so-called paris climate accord  it's a disaster  a death sentence  it's a death sentence for your energy jobs  i took it out  i withdrew from that calamity  biden pledged to reinstate it  it's going to cost you billions and billions of dollars  you know what it really is  it's a way of really taking advantage of the united states  this is what it is  last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county  anybody ever hear of beaver county  the largest investment in your state's history  all made possible by our pro-energy policies  biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600 000 pennsylvania workers  it's probably 940 000 they say  think of that  also  prices and everything else  now biden today came out and said  ""no  no  fracking's okay  it's okay  did you see that  fracking's okay  because he was getting killed  and now we came out in favor of law enforcement  look at all these handsome cops here  and a beautiful cop  if you would see how beautiful  if you would see how beautiful this is  it was like this perfect evening  the sun was setting  the faces of these great  great majestic heroes of our country  right  heroes of our country  and they want to blow mount rushmore  but how about this one  the democrats yesterday came out with a plan  did you see it  now  they're the dc democrats  they want to change the name of the washington monument  perhaps take it down  thomas jefferson  pretty good thomas jefferson  right  you could forget about ever hearing that name again  abraham lincoln  you could forget about it  they want to take down all statues  all monuments in washington  we have some of your greatest people right here  let me not even talk to the congressmen  the heck with the congressman  the boiler makers  how do you like  how do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great george washington  thomas jefferson  abraham lincoln  andrew jackson  all of them  i don't think the boiler makers  you'll do a ring around washington right  along with christopher columbus  he's in big trouble i'll tell you  except there was one  there was a group of great italians in new york  they tried to take down  they tried to take down christopher columbus statue in new york  you saw what happened  right  these italians formed a little circle  they said  ""come on "" the agitators decided to leave  ""let's get out of here darling "" they protected christopher columbus  the italians  now the italians aren't big on taking down christopher columbus  you take down those statues you can forget about the italian vote  do we agree  but they protected it  when asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels  including coal  and fracking  and natural gas  and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work  and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country  biden said  ""no  we would absolutely not allow anything like that  we would make sure it's totally eliminated "" that's what he said  he said  ""we would make sure it's totally eliminated or eliminated "" now he's coming and saying  ""this isn't working too well  this isn't working "" and i made a speech a week ago in texas  we had crowds that were unbelievable  on the highways  you can't get in  but the highways  it's like incredible  you could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money  go to ebay  even as a used ticket  you could probably sell  but you go down the highways and you see it  and i was thinking of texas  i'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil  they like god  and you know what else they like  they like their second amendment  right  so think about it  so whether it's pennsylvania  or texas  or oklahoma  or north dakota  or any place  you take a look at this  right  and no oil  no guns  no god  i don't think george washington running with abraham lincoln as his vp  he'll pick abraham lincoln as vp is going to win in texas  or in pennsylvania  or any place else with those three things eliminated  that's what they want to do  they want to take away your second amendment  if i weren't president  you would either have an obliterated second amendment or it would be gone entirely  i am standing between them and your second amendment  and that's it  that's it  they know  we put baido in charge of guns  baido is in charge  he wants to get rid of everything  baido  that's a beauty  remember he said  ""i was born for this "" anybody that says they're born for this  remember baido  he was on the cover of a magazine  i won't mention the magazine  they're back there  it's a total phony magazine  but he was on the cover of the magazine  and he said  ""i was born to run for president "" he was born for it  i was born  anybody that gets that character  that was when he was doing well  since then he's cratered  ever since he made that statement  he's looked very bad  but take a look at what he says about guns  and he got put in charge of guns  so i guess biden pretty soon he's going to be coming out saying  ""no  no  i never said that "" check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way  but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that  and then he figures later on  he'll go  but everything he said is right  because he has no control over what's happening  the radical left has captured the party  they even elected a person that nobody ever heard of  a senator  it's been a while  against a young  good looking kennedy by 10 points in massachusetts  did you know kennedy lost in massachusetts  you know why  because he wasn't a radical left  he was like a semi-normal person  just slightly left  no  but think of it  this is what's happened  and this is really what's happened  if you're not a radical lefty  meaning guns  meaning fossil fuels  they want wind  wind  to make the windmill  which are made mostly in china  and in germany  by the way  to make it  so much emission is let out  that is more than you can ever save  it's just the craziest thing  also  i am truly an environmentalist  but you have to understand  when we do things and they don't  and we clean  and it's very expensive to do that and they don't  and we have this massive planet  and china  india  russia  germany  all these places  it's fuming up and we're doing our job and beautiful  no  they have to do it also  otherwise  it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to  they want to ban straws  has anybody ever tried those paper straws  they are not working too good  right  they want to ban straws  i said  well  i've had a couple of meals at mcdonald's  et cetera over the years  right  wendy's  a friend of mine owns wendy's  i'll give it a plug  right  burger king  so they want to ban straws  i said  ""oh really  what about the carton  what about the plate  what about the knives and the spoons that are plastic "" oh  they're okay  but the straws we got ban  has anybody ever tried  seriously  the new straw  it's made out of paper  right  it disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie  this would have no chance  by the time you get finished  the straw is totally disintegrated  does anybody walk around with a plastic straw  because it's that bad  you whip it out  boom  boom  you never had to do that  when asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda  you know what the answer is  right  it's the green new deal  right  this green new deal  this was made up by people that don't get it  either that or people that just don't like our country very much  but biden replied yes  he'll get rid of those jobs  and he famously told a voter  ""i want you to look in my eyes "" when he's not wearing the mask because i've never seen a man that liked their mask  look  i'm all for it  we have a big weekend  distance on the weekend  and all of that stuff  and wear your mask when you're close together in particular  and wash your hands  all those things  we have labor day weekend coming up  but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him  and then he makes a speech and he always has it  not always  but a lot of times he has it hanging down  because you know what  it gives him a feeling of security  if i were a psychiatrist  right  i'd say  ""this guy's got some big issues "" hanging down  hanging down  congressman  give me your mask  i want to have it hanging from my ear  i don't want to touch your damn mask  mike i'll never touch your mask  no  but the new one is  i went for a physical  the doctor said to me  ""sir would you like to go over to walter reed  it's incredible "" by the way  the job they do on people that have been just really hurt  our heroes  the job they do is incredible  ""sir would you like to go over and do a physical  you have some time "" you know why i had time  some deal  oh  it was china  i decided not to see china because i didn't like the way they were doing business  okay  does that make sense  so the doctor  white house doctor  highly respected  sean  sean conley  ""sir would you like to go over and do your physical  or do a piece of it  or finish it "" or whatever it was  but do a physic  i said  ""i don't know  i'm not in love with the idea "" ""well  if you do it  you don't have to do窶ｦ"" ""okay  let's go  come on "" so we went  we went  and we're driving  now you have to understand  they're like a hundred cars  you see what happens here  it's like the plane times 50  so the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital  i get out  i was there probably for an hour and a half  two hours  and then yesterday i read that i had strokes  cnn  fake news cnn right there  no  it's true  mini strokes they called them  i don't know what a mini stroke is  but it's not good  and there could be a day and i'll admit  i said ""hey  it happens all of us "" right  except these young ones  it's never going to happen to them  and i'd look at it at that  but you know what happens  but nothing happened  so i went in  i did that part of the physical  the end result was he's very healthy  they were very unhappy when they heard that result  what you don't remember is when this took place  it was a long time ago  they just started up because they want to try and get me to be in biden's physical level  they view me as being somebody that's  i go around  hey  last week  this week  texas  north carolina  florida  south carolina  back to washington  let's go here  let's go there  let's go everywhere  meetings all the time  i think i've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history  and mean questions  i watched biden yesterday  so he hasn't answered questions in what  two months or something  and yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like i've never seen  one young woman who i think is there  one young woman is smiling  ""hi  hi  hi  hi  i just like to ask you  i'm sorry to bother you with this question "" it's the most incredible  so the doctor wrote a letter saying  ""no  this rumor is wrong "" and i don't like  rumors like that  and by the way  if it were a fact  it's fine  it should  i think it's an important thing  but if it's not true  my wife was like  she came to me  she said  ""i think i would have known that "" i said  ""yeah  i think they would have known it too  because they drove back with me "" the press follows me  they have a special deal  and then they followed me and then we go in  we go out  but if you remember  last time  i go in  i spend a little time  a physical like we all have  hopefully you have them  good thing to have i guess  as long as they give you a good answer  if they give you a bad answer don't bother  possibly too late  but i go in  i come out a couple of hours later i guess  whatever it is  it's a short time later  i get into the car  the press sees me get into the car  on my way home  i get a call from my wife  the first lady who's very popular  do we like our first lady  very popular  great person  great woman  she said  ""darling  are you okay "" i go  ""why do you ask "" she said  ""they're reporting that you had a heart attack "" now you have to understand i'm driving in a car  which is about what  six cars in front of the press  because they have a big car  they're a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible  make it uncomfortable  but they're right behind me  so they know i got in and cnn reported that i had a heart attack  that was the same visit  and that didn't work  no it's unbelievable  cnn reported i had a heart attack so my wife was concerned  i said  ""no  not that i know of  and if i did  i think i'd be back there  no  i'll be home in 15 minutes  darling  thank you for caring "" it's always nice  it's always nice  she sounded relieved  that's good  when your wife sounds relieved  but she said  "" i wonder how that happened  why did they do that "" because they're fake news  so i go in and that rumor lasted for a little while  like a day or two  it lasted for a little while  no matter what i did  i'm in the same motorcade  i go in  and i go out  they know i'm in the motorcade  i actually have to report it  but i'm in the motorcade  and they said i had a窶ｦ one of them said it was a massive heart attack  think of it  again  it could happen someday  okay  and when it does  i hope things work out  but they knew i'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news  now for the same visit  that was the stupidest thing  from now on  when i go for a physical or something or go to the hospital  announce it because this was a quick thing  the doctor  he got me in a lot of trouble  he's a great doctor  i said  ""no more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time "" so now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the new york times who's a third grade reporter writes a book and he said  ""the vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go "" i guess  under anesthesia  do they still call it窶ｦ  in the old days they called it anesthesia  it's essentially the same thing  i don't want to get into a situation like where biden used a record player  remember that  you go home  you turn on your record player  but the anesthesia  and i said  ""how could that be "" so remember  this is the same visit  same visit  they said heart attack a long time  all of a sudden out of this book  and he said  ""suffered mini strokes "" now they get a letter from the white house doctor that said it's totally false  totally false  but they still go with it  they go with it  and they know i'm in the group with them coming back  and i don't know much about a mini stroke  but i assume mr  congressman  if you have a mini stroke  you're not heading back to the white house  right  at least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital  right  so anyway  these are really dangerous people  they are so bad for our country  if we had honest press  it would be so great for the usa  it would be so great  they're just a bunch of phony people  not all of them  you have some very good ones  like about 10%  no  you have some very good ones  you have some great journalists  they know it's phony stuff  they're doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the white house and i just don't think the public is going to fall for it  i don't think the public is going to fall for it  in his best days  25  30 years ago  he was weak  he was weak  as a senator  he was weak  he was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly primetime  i can tell you that  i just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very  very special warriors and dan meuser  dan  thank you very much  great job you're doing  dan  congressman  he's a congressman who have really been warriors for me  you really have been  thank you very much dan  fred keller  fred  thank you  great job  fred  the great john joyce  great  thank you  john  guy reschenthaler  do you know him  guy reschenthaler  what are you doing over there  what happened  you don't get along with these guys  oh  okay  that's good  now i understand  that's good  glenn thompson  great job  great job glenn  really great  and a real good friend of mine  right from the beginning  right  mike  we were in pennsylvania and a friend of ours  a congressman  longterm  right  from kentucky  no  from actually tennessee came up to us  i was getting ready to make a speech  and tennessee is very early voting  remember what he said  this was four years ago  he said  ""i don't know what's happening in pennsylvania  i don't know what's happening in the rest of the country  but if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in tennessee "" he said  ""they're coming from the hills  the roadsides  the rivers "" he said they're coming  people that never really cared to vote  they're great americans  but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing  he said  ""they're miles long  they've got trump here  trump hats  trump pins "" right  tennessee  duncan  congressman duncan  right  remember that mike  that was the first time  i mean  they said that they'd never seen anything like it  tennessee has been incredible by the way  so mike and i listened and we said  ""i wonder what that's all about "" but it is true  people that weren't really political people  they're coming in  and the deal here  like the miss universe  good old miss universe  right  like this  they came with hats  they came with pins  they're loaded with pins  one person had hundreds of pins  they never would've had a pin in their life  but they love the job that we've done and we're going to do it even better in the next four years  another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great congressman  but unfortunately he's a former because he's just  i don't know  he's just a special guy and really has a big  beautiful heart  lou barletta  lou  you look good lou  why don't you run again lou  and a man who is tough  there's this guy  you ever hear of a guy named conor lamb  he's like a lamb  so we heard  because he's in sort of a trumpy area  right  and we heard that he's going to be for trump  but he's going to be fighting for trump  i saw some of his commercials  i thought he was a republican  right  except when he got to washington  he voted with pelosi a hundred percent of the time  craziness  he voted with craziness  and so we thought  this conor lamb guy  he even voted to impeach your president over nothing  zero  zero  and that's very personal  when they do that  that's personal  and i have to say congressmen  196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the senate other than romney  you can have romney i think  remember he was walking with the black lives matter saying  ""yes  i'm a member of black lives matter "" everyone said  ""that's nice  wonderful "" he had a lot of mask on  i'll tell you that  but we did a great job  it was an amazing thing  but this conor lamb was out there fighting it  and he shouldn't have done that  and we have somebody that blows him away  he's more of a hero  he's tougher  he's stronger  he's smarter  he's better looking  not that  that matters  under the me too generation  i don't talk about looks anymore  looks don't matter  doesn't make any difference  i don't talk about looks  me too  me too generation  but i'll tell you  this man is something special  he's a real hero  a real tough guy  and he'll never let you down  sean parnell  just remember that conor lamb  and i remember  because he's like a lamb  he's like a little lamb  weak  got a lot of weak people  we like strong people  don't we  we like strong people  we need strong people right now  we have somebody else in the audience who served as my secretary of energy and he was incredible  he was the governor of texas for what  12 years i think  rick right  12  tell me  14  14 years he was  and he was an incredible governor  and he was an incredible secretary  and he's been an incredible friend  rick perry everybody  there was nobody that got into the race tougher than rick  what he said about me  i'll never repeat again  even my own family didn't like me when he got finished  and when he decided that i would be the one  he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me  but you're great rick  and you did a fantastic job  every place you've been  you've been great  thank you very much  rick perry  thank you  hey rick  how are we doing in texas  00  the polls closed and they only announce if you're way ahead  so they say  ""the polls have closed in the great state of texas  donald trump has won the great state of texas "" 窶ｦ hillary even beat this guy  hillary  hillary came in second in utah  this week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from brazil and from mexico for the rest of the year despite the usmca  sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them  so we stopped that  we're reversing decades of the biden betrayals that decimated pennsylvania jobs  you know that  this state lost  listen to this  one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organizations  one of the worst things that happened  when china came in  they were flat-lined for many years  then they came into this crazy deal  they're considered a developing nation  you see i've been sort of protesting that like  but they're considering china as a developing nation  you get all sorts of things that you would never get  advantages over the united states  well we have very strongly protested that  they're not a developing nation  they're a very powerful developed nation  and you know what  they got to pay what everyone else has to pay  earlier this year i kept my promise to the commonwealth of pennsylvania when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u s -mexico-canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well  everyone said it will never happen  and i had great help from these gentlemen right here  i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging  plundering and rampant theft of pennsylvania and many other places  jobs  that's all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by china and others  joe biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in america  after years and years of rebuilding other countries  we are finally rebuilding our country  it's called america first  we're america first  that's enough  and we're bringing our soldiers back home  you see what's going on  after 19 years in afghanistan  far away places  to bring hope to our inner cities  i created opportunity zones  tim scott  great senator from south carolina worked on it with me  passed criminal justice reform  delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama would never do and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african-american  hispanic-american  asian-american unemployment rates ever recorded by far  and they're now heading back in that direction quickly  democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades  they've failed the asian community  the hispanic community  they failed women  the numbers on women's unemployment were the best in 61 years  biden spent the last 47 years betraying the american people  he was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing  ""no  i never said that  i never said that "" i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african-american community and for all communities and the best is yet to come  perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration  we've been fighting for that  under my administration we achieved the most secure border in american history  we ended catch and release  stopped asylum fraud  and we've deported 20 000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast  thank you ice  ice and border patrol  ice and border patrol  they don't like ice because ice is  they're tough  you got to be tough in that job by the way  anybody up here like to work in ice  i don't think so  let's see  you could probably be okay but you'd rather do what you're doing  right  i agree with you  these are tough guys  they have to be tough  these are bad  bad gang members  i mean you look at ms-13  you look at what's happened with ms-13  you look at 窶ｦ we get them the hell out  sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don't even want to take a chance  they can come back in after what they've done  we had thieves  we had some very bad people in the va and they're all gone  thank you  i love you too  thank you  thank you  such friendly voices  quite beautiful  only in pennsylvania  right  thank you  i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  think of this  obama paid  150 billion for a short-term deal  he gave  1 8 billion in cash  you ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in  100 bills  it's a lot  it's like the size of this  right  now think  1 8 billion  how did you guys allow that to happen  they said we all voted against it  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel  you never know nowadays  right  and i opened the u s  embassy in jerusalem  i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  they've been trying to get that done for 52 years  i got it done immediately  by the way  as far as the capital of israel  jerusalem  they've been talking about many  many presidents  they all promised it  nobody did it  i did it  we get things done  and we just did something that is incredible  even the new york times gave it good reviews  not good reviews  beyond good reviews  tom friedman gave it phenomenal reviews  you believe that  that's we achieved the first breakthrough in middle east peace in decades  a deal with israel and the uae  it's a deal with israel and the uae and that's going to lead and i'm going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal  you'll have peace in the middle east  we want to get the hell out  let's get them all back  let's get thel all back  don't forget  we're energy independent  there used to be a reason  now we do have a reason  it's called israel  and we have some very good partnerships over there  in all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries  but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling  our military has never been stronger than it is now  it's new and it's beautiful and i told you we took over 100% of the isis caliphate in iraq and syria and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi  and separately  we killed the world's number one terrorist  number one terrorist for decades and decades  qasem soleimani  we killed soleimani  it's a big step for the middle east  we kept america out of wars  remember they always said  ""oh  this trump  he's radical  he's really  i mean he's off the 窶ｦ he's too radical  he'll get us in wars "" i kept us out of wars  what happened with north korea  look  i get along with kim jong-un  they say  ""that's terrible he gets along "" no it's good if i get along  if i get along with russia  is that a good thing or a bad thing  i think it's a good thing  these guys only fight to tie  they don't fight to win  you fight to win  you look at what's happening where they're all coming back home  i even reduced in germany because germany  they're an ally  but you know  they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military  so we removed a lot of soldiers out of germany  they're not happy  they said  ""this is going to hurt our economy "" well it's good for our economy  okay  they thought it was going to hurt the german economy  well  they don't treat us right  they don't pay their bills  they're delinquent  you know what delinquent is  they're delinquent  they don't pay their bills  we protect them  they don't pay their bills  we got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the european union which basically they run  together we've been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and biden was there for every one of them  joe biden supported nafta  china's entry into the world trade  he supported the korean deal  the korean deal was so bad  it was so bad  this was a deal that was going to produce to south korea done by crooked hillary clinton  this was a deal that was going to produce 250 000 jobs  she said  "" this will be 250 000 "" and she was right  for south korea  it produced 250 000 jobs  for us  we got nothing  we got losses  we got nothing  it was a terrible deal  i renegotiated  now it's a good deal  they also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens  biden supported cutting social security  he voted for the iraq war  he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed the killing of soleimani  when i did that  he said  ""that's a terrible thing  that's a terrible thing "" everybody in the middle east  they couldn't believe it  they celebrated  some of them quite quietly i must add  sign your mail-in ballot  you sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on election day or early voting  that is not tabulated and counted  you go vote  and then if for some reason after that  it shouldn't take that long  it comes in  they're not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted  but you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff  i'm trying to be nice  i'm trying to be nice  they want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots  now there have been many races over the last year where they've done this and they've been a disaster  you look at new york  they had a congressional race  not a very good congresswoman  very untalented  i know her well  i lived in new york  she's not got much going  they have no idea what the vote is  i think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said  ""what about me "" he's not too happy  her opponent  you look at what happened in paterson  new jersey  you look at what happened in virginia  you look at what happened 窶ｦ there's not a race  and these are small  these are easy to control  they want to send out 80 million unsolicited  i like it much better  they used to say universal  they used to say live ballots  i like the word unsolicited  and solicited  solicited is okay  because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out  that's okay  but you can't  this whole thing with the unsolicited  unsolicited means you're sitting there  we have a big enthusiasm edge  but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots  they have  dogs have gotten ballots and they know i'm right and everybody knows i'm right and they say i'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace  what they do to our country  80 million unsolicited ballots  people that had no idea  people that weren't going to vote in all fairness  it's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm  they're going out to vote  they're all going out to vote  everybody here going to vote  everybody  they have no enthusiasm  so i said  ""so that's unfair  that guy walks and then they'll have somebody knock on the door  say  ""listen  i would like your ballot "" ""i don't want to vote  i don't care about biden  i'm a democrat  i don't care about this guy "" ""well look  where is it "" ""here take it  blah blah blah """" they even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures  what is going on  and they have another provision in some states where you can harvest  that's where you grab them all together and drop them  in nevada  they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election  so that means if we have a close election  could be close  i hope it's not  i hope we have a landslide like you've never seen  but if we have a close election that means nevada has the right to  and i love nevada  i think we're going to win nevada  except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands  millions of unsolicited ballots to people in nevada and people that probably left a long time ago  it's very unfair  it's very unfair  but think of it  they have seven days after the election  did you know that mike  seven days  what does that mean  i want to see the results of the election on november 3  by the way  if it's anything like these other events  it could go on forever  i mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done  they should make that a do-over and i think in paterson they have a do-over  i think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud  theft  people were selling ballots  people were selling ballots  and you know they talk about russia  they're so worried about russia  what about sending out 80 million ballots  that's your real problem  and if russia or china or these other countries want to cheat  all they have to do is forge ballots  it's much easier than the way they have to go about it  right  so we have to put pressure on these people  now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in pennsylvania  you know that  right  we have two judges  we have a state judge  we have a federal judge  i think both highly qualified judges from what i understand  i hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing  so we'll see what happens  we're going to see what happens  the lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted  and if it's not counted  vote  and then they have the job  if it comes in late  and if it's not too late  they have the job of making sure that they don't count it  but follow that ballot because these people  they'll be lost  they'll be gone  the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30% off  20% off  follow your ballot  when i banned travel from china  biden called it hysterical and xenophobic  if we had listened to sleepy joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died  you know that  you know he always gets up today  ""covid-19  covid-19 "" i say  ""joe  look  we got a country "" and i agree with that and we've done a hell of a job  we've done a hell of a job  if you look at some of our numbers  you got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking  your place  i mean this is 窶ｦ when you look at pennsylvania  you're in a shutdown  you have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people  senior citizens  nursing homes  people that are old  especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes  we know that  we learned it  and we opened it up  but the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems  you remember my original statement  right  the cure can't be greater  it was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true  you have to open up this commonwealth  it has to be opened up  it has to be opened up now  but there's what i think they're doing  because you have the same thing in new york  we have a governor in new york who is 36 000 people died  11 000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake  he made a horrible mistake  and i built him a convention center with 2 800 beds and they didn't use it and i sent up a ship  a great hospital ship  a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it and he requested it and then i said  ""you're not using it  why aren't you using it "" he could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship  what a shame how long can you do this for  restaurant  poor guys  you can't  how long can you do this for  the people are going to lose their jobs  they're never going to open again  it's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world  it's a hard business  new york is closed  you're closed  north carolina's closed  michigan's 窶ｦ all democrats  let me tell you  what's going to happen on november 4th  they're going to announce their opening  they're doing this for political reasons  they are  right  john  they're doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible  going into november 3rd  election day  then as soon as the election's over with  win  lose or draw for them  they're going to open it  they got nothing  you know what  it's a shame what they're doing  for political reasons  they'll be open  you'll be open on november 4th  but you know what  from your standpoint  it's very close to the election  it's very far if you have a restaurant  and you can't open your restaurant  you can't open your store  it's a disgrace and they ought to get together  they ought to do it  these are democrat governors in all instances and democrat mayors  when the china virus arrived  we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered  the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since april  think of that  we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country  anywhere in the world  you never hear that from the fake news  they don't want to talk to you about it  this is a big country  this is a tougher country to do that with  the european union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours  if you look now  spain is having a big blow up  france is having a big blow up  now  we've done a great job  we haven't been given credit for it  he always starts off  covid-19  that's all he knows  covid-19  i said  ""what about the economy  what about jobs  what about all the other things we have to do "" all he does  he thinks it's a weak spot  and actually in theory  if we're getting a fair shake from those people back there  it's actually what the job we've done is actually a strong spot  that includes you people  with the ventilators that nobody had  nobody that needed a ventilator  didn't get a ventilator  now we're supplying them all over the world  altogether  the nations of europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the united states  think of that  you don't hear these numbers  cases in the us have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month  and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week  three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials  would have taken two years for another president  i was going to say a normal president  but they'll hit me with 窶ｦ a little truth to that too  now  but for another president  especially  in the last administration  they had the h1n1 pandemic  it was called swine flu  you know  joe always calls it the n1h1  he gets it mixed up  no  it's the h1n1  joee  not that it matters  i guess  no  do you ever notice  he's always calling it the other  he calls it the opposite  he has no clue where he is  but he keeps saying  ""oh  if he was "" well he didn't want the ban china  and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning china  i was the only one that wanted to do it  actually  then we banned europe because i saw what was happening in italy and spain and france  we banned europe  we saved hundreds of thousands  if i didn't do the closing and the opening  so we're at 175 000  far too 窶ｦ look  one is too much because this was given to us by china  and it's a disgrace  it's a disgrace  they could have stopped it  they stopped it from going into china  but not going to the rest of the world  including our country  it's a disgrace  but think of it  joe biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the h1ni swine flu  they said it was incompetent  and the head guy  who now he's trying to retract  it's a little tough  that's one great thing about the tape  he said it was horrible  he said  we did a horrible job  he said  they got lucky  it's not contagious like this  we got  this is a tough one  i can look at that guy and he'll catch it  right there  and he's very far away from me  it's a tough one  because it's so contagious  i tell you what  our vice-president  mike pence  and the task force  headed up by mike and working along with a lot of great people  they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit  if i was a democrat  a different president  and they did the same job  they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen  but take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu  it was a disaster  it was incompetent  they called themselves incompetent  they call  and now they're coming in like  well  we would have done this and biden by the way  was against  you remember  xenophobic  racist  because i closed down china  then two months later  two and a half  three  and nancy pelosi was having dances in chinatown  right  a month later  no  no problem  i was way ahead  then biden comes out and he actually said that i was right  but they said  ""don't say that  try doing it a little softer than that "" he did it a little bit softer  but we were right  they were wrong  they handled it so badly  just take a look  because we  i said to my people  ""we've got to fight this a little bit differently because we're getting a lot of fake news  a lot of bad people saying things""  and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries  it's amazing  if you took new york out of it  which was a disaster by cuomo  if you took new york out of those numbers  we would have numbers that would be even better than they are  i could read numbers that would be even much better  because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because new york was incompetently run by mayor de blasio and governor cuomo  by the way  just today  there's another credible thing happening  pfizer  great company  announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks  very shortly  incredible  under operation warp speed  we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine  in that record time that we talked about  this would have been years later  it'll be delivered before  in my opinion  before the end of the year  but it really might even be delivered before the end of october  how do you like that  wouldn't that be nice  that would be nice  you know why  not because of the electric  it'll be nice because we want to save people  that's why it'll be nice  that's the important thing  together  we will defeat the virus  the job we're doing is  the job that all of the people working on it  our generals  our admirals  the distribution  we bought billions and billions of dollars of things  and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators  very tough  the ventilator's very complicated  very big  very expensive  it's like  i made the statement  it's like building a car  but more sophisticated  they said  ""no  it's not "" they said  they took a ventilator  they took it apart  these people are the worst  the worst  over the next four years  we'll make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world  and we will end our reliance on china once and for all  that's what we'll do  let me just tell you something  if they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment  based on a phone call that was perfect  this stuff would have all been done  would have all been done  truly  it would have all been done  yet  with all of this stuff  the fake russia witch hunt  the fake ukraine  how about that  did anybody read the transcript of that call  it was a perfect call  ""hey  congratulations  good luck "" it was like a perfect call  now they'll take it back and they'll say  ""well  i don't know "" this was a per 窶ｦ in history  there's never been anything like this  it was a totally lopsided  100% political witch hunt  and it goes on and on  these are bad people  i really believe they don't love our country  i watched nancy pelosi  ""you must wear your mask  you have to wear your mask  and we're going to keep every beauty salon closed in california and all over the country "" then i see a picture  i say  ""nancy pelosi  well  where's the mask "" i'll tell you what  she must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly  she uses the salon and the salon turned her in  the salon turned her in  i don't think i would have turned her in  i would've said  ""well  you know  she's a customer  i got to take care of my customers  right "" but she made them open  and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her  how much do they hate nancy pelosi  then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can't be set up  she said  ""i was set up  i was set up by the salon owner  i was set up "" i said  ""tell me she didn't say that  please "" i just put out  that if she was set up  then she shouldn't be leading the house of representatives  i want the salon owner to lead the house of representatives  because she set up 窶ｦ think of it  she set up the speaker of the house  that was a big mistake  as soon as i heard  she said  ""well  she's sent me up "" nancy  you're not supposed to get set up  you're representing our country  you know what she should have done honestly  she should have said  ""i made a mistake  sorry "" and nobody would be talking about  this is like the biggest story  this is the big  crazy nancy  highly overrated person  let me just say she is a highly overrated person  they give her such good play  she is a highly overrated person  look  they just turned off a camera because they don't want me saying that  just in closing  we will rapidly return to full employment  soaring wages and record prosperity  we will hire more police  increased penalties for assault on law enforcement  surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities  we will appoint prosecutors  judges  and justices who believe in enforcing the law  not their own political agenda  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech and the right to keep and bear arms  we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens  we will not let them threaten our citizens  and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars  we will end surprise medical billing  we don't want surprise medical billing  you know what happens  it's terrible  but we have ended it  also  we've signed something that's incredible  you're going to see  some people say it's bigger than healthcare  and i signed it  unfortunately it takes place on january 1st  you better elect me  you better elect me  it's called price transparency  i said to my people at the end of the day  what is price transparency  this is going to lower your prices by 50%  you'll be able to negotiate  you'll be able to do things you're not even allowed to do now  with hospitals  with doctors  you get better doctors  you get lower prices  i said  ""when does it start "" it's a complicated 窶ｦ oh  did i get  i was fought  you have no idea  right fellows  you have fought too  but they fought me on this price transparency  it's bigger than healthcare  could be bigger than healthcare  but i said  ""when does it start "" they said  ""sir  we have it all set "" ""when "" ""january 1st "" ""i said  i'd better win this election "" because you're going to see some unbelievable price reductions  that includes on drugs  because we're reducing health insurance premiums massively  and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years  last year  but now it's going to go down very big  because we did a favorite nation's clause  i see the drug companies are  they're killing me with ads  they have nothing but cash  they have nothing but money  they're spending because they can't believe 窶ｦ germany and other countries pay much less than we do  we want to have  what we have to have  is we have to have a comparison of prices  that's what it is called  favored nation clause  i instituted a favorite  so we're paying  2 50 for a pill  and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory  right  we get the 25 cent price  so  what's going to happen that'll go up  ours will come way down  they can't believe it  the drug companies can't believe  and i will tell you  mark meadows is here  our chief of staff  where's mark  they want to negotiate  they called  we signed it  it's all done  they want to negotiate and they are negotiating  so let's see what happens  but we're going to get you cuts on prescription drugs  the likes of which you've never seen  we'll protect medicare and social security  they will not be able to protect it  it will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  always  america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  when i took over  nasa was dead  now it's the most vibrant space center in the world  by far  we will restore patriotic education to our schools and we'll teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  we will live by the timeless words of our national motto  in god  we trust  for years  you had a president who apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the great people of pennsylvania us  it's where the army weathered its brutal winter at valley forge  and where general george washington  who  by the way  they want all of the name  washington removed from everything  i haven't been keeping up with it  what did he do  george washington  they want the name off  congressman are we okay showing 窶ｦ i don't think you liked that idea too much  george washington  they want his name off everything  but we'll keep it  i promise you this  as long as you canceled culture  you better have a strong president  canceled culture  george washington  can you believe  but he led his men on a daring mission across the delaware  this is the commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of gettysburg and where generations of tough  strong pennsylvania workers  mined the coal  worked the railroads  forged the steel that made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world  that's in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it's ever been before  that's what's going to happen  proud citizens like you  helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country from these very  very deranged people  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help and your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  america will soon be thriving like never before  next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country  and together we will work very hard  the people of pennsylvania  the great  great people of pennsylvania  where i went to college  it's a place i know very well  but  we will make america wealthy  again  we will make america strong again  we will make america proud again  we will make america safe again and we will make

16,4,Nov,2019,datasets/Lexington,"thank you very much and thank you to the original lee greenwood  thank you  thank you  lee  great guy  well  i just want to say a very big hello  kentucky  great place  it's great to be here in the home of a group called the wildcats  you ever hear the kentucky wildcats  by the way  they play at a very big arena  this place  look at this  hello  up there  this is incredible  with thousands of proud  hardworking  freedom-loving american patriots  which is what you are  what you are  tomorrow  the people of kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific republican governor  matt bevin  he's done a fantastic job  he's done a fantastic job  and we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country  to the rest of the world  that the republican party  you know what we stand for  but you see what's happening with the democrats  they have gone crazy  the do nothing democrats  and they're not getting it done  under republican leadership  the economy is booming  wages are rising  confidence is soaring  kentucky is thriving like never ever before  and america is stronger than ever before  true  kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country  that's not bad  and i want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives  and the job that matt bevin has done as governor  he's had to do some things that you had to do  and he's done unbelievably well  it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future  you had to do it  so i just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do  you have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state  and with the help of your senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written  we're supporting our police  we're rebuilding our military  we're defeating radical islamic terrorists like never before  the monsters animal known as al-baghdadi is dead  and the man that took his place is dead also  american special forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell  no enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the united states military  which is now stronger than ever before  we've rebuilt it and it was all made in america  all made in america  and our country is winning again  and our country is highly respected again  but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists  the radical democrats are going totally insane  they want to obliterate the rule of law  drive out faith from the public square  and you know this  silence you online  confiscate your guns  you better be careful  the second amendment very  very important  very precious  they are after your second amendment  with us  nobody's touching our second amendment  and that includes the gentleman that's running against matt  they're after your second amendment  we can't let that happen  they want to indoctrinate your children  you know this  destroy anyone who calls traditional america american values  all you have to do is ask the boys from covington catholic high school  some of whom are here tonight  the far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation  telling you what to think  what to believe and how you should live  they want to erase our traditions  our culture  our history  and our heroes  they want to subjugate you and break you to their will  but kentucky will never be broken  kentucky can't be broken  you're too strong and you're too smart  in their craze thirst for power  the democrats are trying to tear our country apart  first  democrats engineer the russia hoax  the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the american people  the russian hoax  then they did the mueller scam  you remember that  the mueller scam  two years and they said nothing  and then mr  mueller testified  that was a wonderful day for me  you remember last week  i don't know tulsi gabbard  but hillary clinton said that tulsi gabbard is a russian agent  i don't know jill stein  she's a greenie and that's fine  she's a greenie  jill stein  but jill stein was an agent of russia also  these people are crazy  now corrupt politicians  nancy pelosi and adam schiff  they are corrupt  and nancy  unlike kentucky  which is doing great  nancy ought stop wasting time  go back to her district in san francisco  help the homeless  get rid of the drugs  get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street  and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system  what's happened is san francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left democrats  it's unbelievable  los angeles  you take a look at los angeles  looks like a third world city  but go back to nancy's area  look at what's happened  there's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that nancy pelosi represents  and she's wasting all of her time  and you know what  it's backfiring  you see it  but the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation  with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt  impeachment  think of it  so today  we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market  now  that's hundreds of days  so last week  think of this  in the history of our country  it's never done better  and by the way  that's not rich  that's not poor  that's for everybody  your 401s  how you are doing  pretty good  right  pretty good  people tell me that their wives  their husbands  all of a sudden  they've been running the 401s for years  and they totally lost respect for let's say  the husband  totally lost respect  now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%  she says  darling  i love you  you are the most incredible  brilliant financial mind  and you know what  if the democrats get in  that's not going down by 50%  that's going down to nothing  it's going to be worthless  it's going to be worthless  you'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen  mark my words  but hopefully  we don't have to even think about it  and that was going to happen here  when we took over  that was going down in the wrong direction  and don't forget  that was zero interest  we're paying interest  in other words  people are now getting interest in their money  but that was with zero interest  real easy with zero interest  last week  the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of americans  to be exact 63 million people  disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives  they've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won  and actually  before we won  they were plotting to overthrow this election  before we won  19 minutes after i took the oath of office  that disgusting washington post  look at all these people back there  look  fake news media  it's the fake news  look at all of them  what they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years  or 13 years  or maybe 17 years  or maybe if i still have the strength  21 years  see  now they're going crazy  now they're saying  see  i told you  he was a dictator  he wants to take charge in control of our country  these people are crazy said  the guy goes  well  we're going to fight and we're going to 窶ｦ no  no  he's going to win  you know he's never leaving office  don't you  he's never going to leave office  these people are crazy  they're crazy  but that disgusting newspaper that's right there  the washington post  declared the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun  all right  you can get them out  be gentle  be gentle  be very gentle  you know every time i say  get them out of here  i end up getting sued  they say  he hurt my arm  all right  so be very gentle  please  i don't want to get sued  be very gentle  very  very gentle  he's going home to mom  thank you  by the way  do we love our law enforcement  and in the whole world  even on a monday night  i like the monday nights because i think we're 58 and 0  that's a good record  even for the wildcats  that's a good  we're 58 and 0  but even on a monday night  is there anything cooler than being at a trump rally  nothing can  with last week's vote  the far left has declared war on american democracy itself  these people are lunatics  in the face of these attacks  republicans are the most unified that i've ever seen  and i've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time  and the democrats have never witnessed anything like it  and they know they're not going to win in 2020  so let's see what can we do to win  but that's not working too well  you'll see  the american people are fed up with democrat lies  hoaxes  slander  the democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon  tomorrow  kentucky has a chance to send the radical democrats a message  you will vote to reject democrats extremism  socialism and corruption  and you will vote to reelect kentucky governor matt bevin who's done a great job  matt's a veteran  he's a patriot  he's done it all  he's been a very  very successful business leader  he put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible  under his leadership  kentucky has created over 57 000 new jobs  but i helped also  we work together  now  he is difficult  i have to say  you know  maybe because of the election  but it's okay  look  he's such a pain  when he needs something for kentucky like money  like aid  like  he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into kentucky  could you call the head of some company in japan  please  i say  ""matt  do i have to do it "" please  please  but isn't that really what you wanted in a governor  that's what you want  he's such a pain in the ass  but that's what you want  and the job he's done  one of the best in the country  not the best  he's been incredible  matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration  thank you  he's pro-worker  pro-life and 100% pro-second amendment  by the way  you're going to lose your second amendment if you vote in democrats  you think i'm kidding  i see what they're saying  i watch what they're doing  they're calling me all the time  you will lose your second amendment as soon 窶ｦ i'm telling you  as sure as you're standing here  is anybody sitting  nobody ever sits  you can sit if you want  no  just stand  you know what they say in the fake news  look  you've been standing  nobody sat  i don't know  isn't that exciting  nobody sat  you know what they say  no  you know what they say  they say  trump only got one standing ovation  because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down  but they don't say the second part  it's great  great spirit  you know why  you love our country  and you see what's happening  we have turned this big monster ship  we have turned it around  and we need so badly  you know  it's like you plant a tree  it takes a lot  we have to get those roots to hold  we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country  so many things  so many things  the best employment numbers  we have the best of everything  and i think i'm going to count but i think it's like 118  i told you  we have a record stock market today  i think about 100 窶ｦ i'm going to have to check it  because you know with the fake news  if i'm off by half a point  if it's 117 and not 118  even if i go under  they report it  they say  he didn't tell the truth  it was really 119  but like a lot  over 100  where we had the highest stock market in our history  think of that  that's incredible  but matt bevin has made record investments in education spending for kentucky students  education is so important to him  matt bevin will defend your kentucky values  he loves his state  from an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left  not good  i can't even imagine  how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left  this guy  beshear  is a major lefty  you know that  right  why are we even 窶ｦ let's just have a good time  are you sure we need an election tomorrow  matt  i don't know  how does kentucky vote for a person 窶ｦ i'm telling you  he will always vote for pelosi and schumer and shifty schiff  how about this guy  how about schiff  he makes up a conversation  he gets up before the united states congress  he repeats my conversation with the head of the ukraine  the new president  a good guy  repeats it  i said  ""i never said that "" he made a horrible statement  it was a total lie  and then i actually wanted to release the actual conversation  and you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that  have you  because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks  you're going to find out  but these are very dishonest people  shifty schiff  but matt's running against these people  and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous  the radical left named andy beshear  who rejects everything kentucky stands for  that's who they want to win  beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of donald trump  what are the policies  take care of our vets  take care of our military  we want jobs  we want companies to stop leaving us  they're not leaving anymore  you see  companies aren't leaving anymore  have you noticed  remember years ago before i ever thought of doing this  i mean  when i said let's do this  i said to our great now first lady  i said  ""melania  let's give it a shot "" and then  one by one  we were doing good  and what we've done  if you remember before we ran  companies were leaving kentucky  they were leaving  they will go into mexico  they were going to china  japan  they were going all over  any place but kentucky  you don't read about that at all  now they're all coming back  they're all coming back  but beshear wants to shut down your coal  shut down your energy  raise your taxes  and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of kentucky  the greatest economy you've ever had  he's going to destroy it  and it won't be long  it'll go very quickly  you know  you're all sitting there  everybody has good jobs  you don't like it  you go find another job  it's like the choice i got from military  i got you choice too  if you don't like your job  you find another one  you tell the boss  i am getting out of here  i don't like this guy  you go get a better job for more money  beshear doesn't represent you  he represents the washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election  beshear supported crooked hillary clinton  and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics  open borders  let everyone pour right in  let them all pour right in  beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to kentucky  think of that one  releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent kentucky families  he wants sanctuary cities  he hasn't learned what's happened  we had a great election a couple of weeks ago in north carolina  we won two house seats  we were supposed to lose  probably both of them  we won them by a lot  we won them by a lot  and i think we won them because of the second amendment  because it's under assault from democrats  but i think we won also because of sanctuary cities  because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities  really bad  and i think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot  beshear is too liberal  too extreme and too dangerous for the state of kentucky  tomorrow  everybody needs to vote  republican  we got to go republican all the way  i want to bring up a man  and i'm serious about this  this guy works so hard  he's a great natural talent in business  which you needed  and he straightened it out  and i'll tell you what  he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state  matt bevin  come on up matt  so we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in washington  your great senator mitch mcconnell  nobody works harder for kentucky than mitch  i will tell you  nobody works harder  and frankly  maybe more importantly  nobody works smarter  it's up here  i know a lot of people that work hard  he works smart  when the democrat arsonists in washington tried to destroy an innocent man named brett kavanaugh  now justice brett kavanaugh  mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob  and that's what it was  it was a mob  there has never been a man treated so badly in washington as judge kavanaugh  previously judge  now justice  we got him in  and he's been great  and he will be great  mitch confirmed two tremendous supreme court justices  mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass va choice and va accountability for our amazing veterans  now  i know mitch's opponent because they came here  do you remember last year  slightly different location  and that's okay  it was still the great state of kentucky  because andy barr had amy mcgrath  an extreme liberal against him  andy barr is here with us tonight  and we're going to introduce him  but he beat her  so she said to herself  ""well  you know  i failed in congress  now let's go for the senate "" she wanted to go to the house  now she wants to go  it's not going to work that way  extreme liberal  anti-gun  lots of different things  amy mcgrath compared my election  think of this one 窶ｦ it's so insulting  i shouldn't say it  should i say it  yeah  why not  no  it's so insulting  you know  you work so hard  you love your country so much  and they get up to say things  she compared it to 9/11  a slander upon our nation  she wants open borders  she supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody  she wants to get rid of it  she wasn't too happy with me last year  we came in  andy  and we did a job on her  and this is going to be easy  she was caught telling donors  democrats  that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of kentucky  is that what you want  it's not what you want  so next november  the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed kentucky conservative  mitch mcconnell  but we're going to get back to that later  we'll be back many times  we'll be back here many times  mitch  where is he  so president obama left mitch  and me  and rand  and all of us  he left 142 openings for judges  you're not supposed to allow any  you don't do that  you know  they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges  right  including the supreme court  obviously  i came in and i said  ""how many do we have "" they said  ""how many what  sir "" i said  ""judge openings "" and i thought they'd say none  or one or two  he said  ""sir  we have 142 "" i said  ""what "" i said  ""tell me again "" he said  ""we have 142 "" so mitch and i and rand would like to thank very much president obama  because nobody ever been so generous in their life  also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy  smart  strong  loves your state  and he's really become a good friend of mine  and i'll tell you  he's a little bit different  it's okay  but whenever i've needed him  whenever i needed him  he was always there  it's true  i mean  sometimes like i'd say  "" i don't need you to vote  rand "" ""good "" and he'll vote his own way  he's got that little libertarian touch  that's okay  that's okay  but whenever we need  and i'm not talking about me  i'm talking about we  we need a vote  he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend  i want to have him come up for a second  rand paul  your senator  a great warrior  wow  that was excellent  whoa  wow  thank you  thank you very much  rand  great job  he's a warrior  he's a warrior  i've always said it  also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic  a couple from outside your state  but we'll welcome them also  right  but these are also great fighters  great warriors  hal rogers  thank you  hal  brett guthrie  thank you  brett  thomas massey  man we just spoke about won a great grace  andy barr  james comer  james  great  and from an incredible state that we won 2016 that crooked hillary said she's going to win that state  didn't come too close at winning that state  it's a great state  and we love the people of north carolina  congressman mark meadows  along with some of your local great politicians  and a person that's done a really spectacular job  you know  in michigan  a woman  she just kept going  she just kept going  reminded me  by the way  of your governor  from the standpoint she never quit  now  republicans hadn't won michigan in many  many years  she called  ""could you come again  could you do it again  could you come make another speech  please "" i said  ""all right  this is the last one "" ""no  no  no  how about a couple of more "" and then bill clinton actually told hillary clinton  ""you better get going  something's going on in michigan  you're going to lose michigan  you better start going "" ""no  no  no  the polls say everything's good "" and we won the great state of michigan for the first time in many years  and i said  when it came time to picking the republican party chair  head of the rnc  i said  i got to get the woman from michigan  ronna mcdaniel  to head it up  and when they were saying how sophisticated hillary clinton's campaign was 窶ｦ you know  we're not sophisticated  right  i don't think so  remember all during the 窶ｦ ""well  she's got the finest computer technology in the world "" yeah  she paid for it  but she didn't get it  ""she has really fantastic geniuses "" but i had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had  his name was brad parscale  and he's here with us  campaign manager  doing a great job  and our numbers are looking very good  but think of it  we're one day short of a year now  can you believe it  less than a year  it begins november 3rd this time  we had that great  great date  oh boy  november 8th remember  was there ever a day like that in television history  and they have no idea  because when we do hang it up  they're all out of business  they know that  that's why i think that we will get 窶ｦ i expect to get a full  hearty  unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing new york times  and from the amazon washington post  you know  before the election started  about a month before i announced that i was going to do this  i said  ""i'm going to become a politician  i can't believe it  i'm going to become a politician "" but i looked at the new york times  and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store  right  the wind would blow it away  it was dead  i call it the failing new york times only because eventually it will fail  but we built it up  they do stories 窶ｦ in my entire life  i had a few stories on the front page of the new york times  and now if i have three or four a day  it's like  ""why are they not covering me anymore "" and they're all bad  they can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world  and they make it look as bad as possible  in fact  i love dogs  but they gave the dog full credit  they didn't give me any credit  that's okay  the dog got the credit  and the dog will be coming very shortly  by the way  to the white house  but they'll be endorsing us  and you know  all of these crazy  like cnn with its bad ratings  there goes its red light  it just went off  their red light just went off  see how it is  well  it's hard  look  put yourself in their position  they have it on  their covering  and now they know they're ready to get hit  so they turn it off  i mean  i can't blame them  their red light just went off  no  but put yourself in cnn's position  without us 窶ｦ you know  cable was not supposed to be a good business  then we came along  it's not me  it's we  they came from the valleys  they came from everywhere  the cities  they came from places  they're still trying to figure out  ""where the hell did all those people come from "" it's true  a great senator from tennessee  they have early voting  and i was in pennsylvania making a speech  and he saw me because he had a couple of great congressman friends from pennsylvania  and he said  ""you know  in tennessee we have very early voting  and i just left  and i've been doing this for 24 years  and i got to be honest with you  i've never seen so many people vote "" and these are people  they love our country  they're incredible  they work hard  but they never liked what they were voting for  so they really wouldn't vote  sounds terrible  but they didn't like anything that they saw  they say  ""sir  i'm seeing people "" and he said this  ""come out from the valleys  come out from the mountains  come out from areas that they've never come out  we have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor "" he said  ""i can't speak for the rest of the country  but if the rest of the countries like tennessee  you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation "" and that's what happened  that was a great statement  that was a great statement from people from a great state  also  tomorrow you must elect the entire republican ticket  from governor on down  including your next lieutenant governor  ralph alvarado  ralph alvarado  great  ralph  you're a good man  and your next attorney general  daniel cameron  should i bring daniel up  get up here  daniel  come on  here's a star  here's a star  mr  president  i hope you can tell that kentucky is trump country  we are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues  and here in the commonwealth  we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves  and mr  president  we are going to stand with you in protecting the second amendment rights of all kentuckians  and mr  president  i make a personal commitment to you as the next attorney general  we are going to make sure that kentucky is never a sanctuary state  good  that's good  thank you  daniel  thank you  daniel  star  a star is born  a star is born  did you ever see that movie  a star is born  thank you  daniel  great  you're next secretary of state  michael adams  thanks  michael  auditor  mark harmon  thank you  mark  treasurer  allison ball  she's doing great  and agriculture commissioner  ryan quarles  with the help of everyone here  america is the hottest economy anywhere in the world  by far  foreign leaders come in to see me  ""congratulations on your economy "" china's doing poorly  as you know  but they're paying us billions  and billions  and billions of dollars  and they've never given us 25 cents before  billions of dollars  they gave a lot of that money to our farmers  who got targeted  but no longer  they're back buying from our farmers  but we've created 6 7 million new jobs since the election  and if i would have ever said that during the campaign  the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it  think of that  6 7  and today  just today  a record  158 million americans are now employed  the highest level of employment in our country's history  african american unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country  hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows  the history of our country  hourly earnings  listen to this  are up 9% since the election  nobody ever thought that was going to be happening  under the previous two administrations  we lost 60 000 factories  i thought that was a typo  i said  ""how the hell can you lose 60 000 "" it turned out to be right  and you know how i know  because i've been saying it for two years  and they never corrected me  it's true  two years  i get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign  ""sir  sir  we have an emergency "" ""what's the emergency "" ""somebody's calling from the media  the fake news  did you put a comma in the wrong location  sir  because they consider it to be a front page story "" okay  under my administration  we've added nearly 10 000 new factories and many  many more thousands of factories are coming into our country  we reversed it  to get relief to working families  we passed massive tax cuts  massive  to lift up distressed communities  our tax law created opportunity zones  tim scott of south carolina was so involved  including 144 designated by your great governor  by the way  the other governor  i don't think 窶ｦ well  i don't know  you know  he's not going to do so well  he'll be calling for a meeting  and i won't be able to see him because i don't like him very much  but i like this one very much  and we're going to help him  we slashed a record number of job-killing regulations  we ended the war on american energy  we're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world  and we ended the war on beautiful clean coal  i announced the withdrawal of the united states from the horrible  costly  one-sided paris climate accord  ask them how they're doing in paris with it  not too good  i canceled the so called clean power plan  and repealed obama's federal coal moratorium  we're putting our great miners back to work  on trade  we're starting to set records every week  we're reversing decades of washington disloyalty  stupidity  and corruption  past administrations did nothing as china looted our factories  and stole up to  500 billion of american dollars  by the way  people can't even believe it  not 500 million  that's a lot  if you lost 500 million  that's a lot  i thought that was another typo   500 billion they would take a year from us  we rebuilt china  and i give them a lot of credit  by the way  i give china  what i don't give credit to is obama and past administrations beyond obama  i don't give them credit because they let it happen  they should have never let it happen  but now we're taking in tens of billions  and billions  and billions of dollars  just recently  very slow  slippy joe 窶ｦ biden that is  said of china's piracy and plunder  ""they're not that bad  folks "" he always used the word folks  i watched him today  he used the word folks  ""hi folks  hi  hi  my time is up  i got to leave "" no  they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks  so i can just see these handlers  because they're handlers  like they use on horses  they're handlers  right  ""all right  get him off now  he's been up there long enough "" so they're screaming  ""get off  get off  sleepy joe  get off the stage  please  please joe  you're doing fine  joe  you're doing fine  you're doing fine "" and then he goes  ""i love being in ohio "" but he was in iowa yesterday  yes sir  and they say  ""dammit  he should have left sooner  we told him  get off the stage  sleepy joe  sleepy joe  get off the damn stage "" but he said about  sleepy joe  about china  ""they're not that bad  folks  they're not really competition for us  no  they're not "" 500 billion a year  right  he did nothing in eight years  him and obama  in fact  i'm here because of them  when you think about it  right  just thinking  i'm here because of them  kellyanne conway  stand up  kellyanne  stand up  another warrior  i just saw kellyanne  i said stand up  no  but think of it  as somebody saying that  now look   1 5 billion that hunter  who got thrown out of the navy  who had no experience  who had not anything  got a lot of money from ukraine  but he got 1 5 billion from china  i got to tell you  i've been negotiating with china  they're very tough  china  i got to tell you  i've been negotiating with china  they're very tough  that is not the same group of chinese people that i've been negotiating with  they gave him 1 5 billion  he'll make millions and millions with that  and how about saying  by the way  mr  president  would you please take over the negotiations that president trump is no longer handling  guess what  you would be sold down the tubes so fast  and we're so close  china wants to make a deal so badly  i think they'd love to see another president  they would like to see another president more than crooked hillary would  okay  can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal  which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made  has to be  because we started down here and they were up there  has to be  can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations  this is what china would love more than anything else  it's not going to happen folks  because we can't let our country go back to hell  we can't do it  we can't let it happen  because the bidens got rich while america was robbed  and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in  i watched the last debate  and this weakling named anderson cooper saying  well  it's totally unsubstantiated  mr  biden  solely answer  what's unsubstantiated  he is on tape doing a real quid pro quo  sure  it's totally unsubstantiated  sir  i've never seen anything like it  could you imagine if i did what he did  could you imagine if don jr  or eric trump walked out of china while i was  let's say  vice president or president  let's say they walked out of china with 1 5 billion  do you think the press would be saying  well  it's unsubstantiated  no  it's something  let me just tell you something  these people  not all of them  but these people are very dishonest people  very  very dishonest  but under this administration  the great betrayal is over  america is not for sale  and we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp  and that's what we're doing with these crazy people  a lot of bad things happened  and a lot of bad things i think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with  let's face it  these are bad people  thanks to my tariffs  we will soon have over  100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us  and i'll tell you  they started buying our farm product  you see that  they started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done  last year  i got our farmers  16 billion because they were targeted  and the year before i got them  12 billion  i just took them out of the tariffs  and we had a lot leftover  and i said  congratulations farmers  i love you  i love our farmers  they love me  that's why they did  they targeted our farmers  i said  congratulations  that's compliments of china  and they do  they want to make a deal so badly  frankly  honestly  they want to make a deal a lot more than i want to make a deal  that's the way it is  because we're doing very well right now with china  we're replacing the nafta disaster with the us  mexico  canada agreement  a huge win for kentucky farmers  for kentucky auto workers  for kentucky manufacturers  unfortunately  nancy pelosi so far and the do nothing democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory  it's really  let it be a bipartisan deal  i don't care  it's such an incredible deal for this country  and nafta was one of the worst deals ever made  democrats need to pass the us mca  we need their votes  otherwise you can't pass it  and it's up to pelosi who has to put it forward  but she's too busy wasting their time  so either pass it or go back to san francisco and clean up your mess  the obama biden's administration's trans-pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the american auto industry  that would have been one of the great catastrophes  my first week in office  i canceled that job-killing travesty  you know all about it  under our policies just days ago  ford and the uaw announced a  1 billion investment in louisville  1 billion  before my election  our leaders used the great american middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects  they were globalists  i was elected to be president of the united states  not president of the globe  they decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries  tell me  how is that good  they try and convince you it's good  i was a very good student  i'm a very like  we're all smart  we sit back  we listen  and i say  these people are  something wrong with them  only in kentucky can somebody be so precise  you're right about  you are right about that  they deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations  subsidizing their welfare states with your money  the money we spend on other country's militaries  but it's coming down  and i'm telling other countries  i'm sorry  you're going to have to pay now  i'm sorry  pay  pay  pay  you got to pay  and they poured precious american blood and treasure into the middle east while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair  we go in for internet  we want rural  we'll bring it in  and we're bringing 5g into places like kentucky that haven't been properly served  we're bringing it in all over the middle west  all over the country  and we're really ahead of schedule  we're doing really well  people will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out  but we're doing very well  but you were very much underserved for years  and yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of  doesn't make sense  does it  but after years of rebuilding other nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  we are finally putting america first  yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past  they believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world  no thank you  no thank you  that's why we ended the paris accord  that's why窶ｦ we've ended a lot  i don't even want to tell you  but the sellout of the american nation ended the day i took the oath of office and you understand that  past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones  then they demanded that america accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions  take the people  take the people  we defeated isis  we  when i took over three years ago  when we took over  when i took over  isis was all over  i defeated isis  i didn't even know to what extent  i was watching the other night the great lou dobbs  and he said  ""when trump took over  president trump "" he used to say  ""trump is a great president "" then he said  ""trump is the greatest president since ronald reagan "" then he said  ""no  no  trump is an even better president than ronald reagan "" and now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country  including george washington and abraham lincoln  thank you  we love you too  but we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here  we didn't do that  we're not doing that  you see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because i get hit by the swamp 15 different ways  but it doesn't matter  we're doing the right thing to protect our communities  my administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries  a lot of people were against it  they said  ""isn't that terrible "" countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible  and we have a travel ban now  we don't take people from those countries  i'm sorry  and we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the united states supreme court  ruled it totally constitutional  on no issue have democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration  democrats want open borders  they want to give illegal aliens free healthcare  free education  more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets  in the republican party  we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border  illegal crossings have dropped 60% since may  the wall is being built  it's going up rapidly  it's got a big impact  and i want to thank mexico  we have 27 000 mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the democrats will not do anything to end loopholes  it would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes  think of the word loopholes  they don't want to end the loophole  if you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities  you have only one choice tomorrow  and that's to vote for matt bevin  democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day  the democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate medicare  what are they doing  i will always protect medicare for our nation's seniors  it's going to be protected  what they're doing is crazy  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  and we will also protect you with preexisting physicians  how about that  preexisting physicians  first time i've ever said that  just thought of that  true  because under their plan  you don't get your own doctor  you know what you get  whatever the hell you get  that's what you get  oh great doc  fix me up doc  you mean you want to work on my heart  who are you  doc  i don't think so  thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help  we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in kentucky  which is a record  democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith  anybody in here a person of faith  great people  the last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs  last week my administration took action to stop that obama era assault  it was an assault  and governor matt bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children  and there is no better leader than him  what he has done  and together we're fighting for american orphans  foster families  and the sacred rights of religious believers  and he's done a fantastic job  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth  and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and it's the party of the great abraham lincoln  we forgot that  abraham lincoln  the incredible rebuilding of our military includes over  100 billion investments all across the state of kentucky  i withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided iran nuclear deal  it's not the same country  when i came in that country  there were in 18 different sites of confliction  they called it  and now they're a little different  a little different  we'll see what happens with iran  and i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  for years  you watched as your politicians apologized for america  remember  he'd go around  oh  thank you so much  he wouldn't apologize to you  but he apologized to others  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for the people of kentucky  the next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you  you have to do this  look  maybe you'll be late for work  maybe you'll be late for whatever  i don't want to know everything  some things i don't want to know  but you have to just put it off  you have to go vote  it's so important  tomorrow is so  because beyond even the governorship  and it's so important  because again  your state is setting records  in the history of your state  you've never done this well economically  job wise  unemployment  employment  factories moving in  new factories  open expansion of your car plants  you've never done this well  but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country  it's so important  you got to get your friends  you got to vote  because if you lose  it sends a really bad message  it just sends a bad  and they will build it up  here's the story  if you win  they're going to make it like ho hum  and if you lose  they're going to say  trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world  this was the greatest  you can't let that happen to me  and you know what  you can't let that happen to your incredible state  kentucky  you can't let that happen  that would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor  but you're going to have a great victory tomorrow  with your support  you have to go out and vote  we will show the corrupt democrats that the american people are not backing down and we will never ever back down  so tomorrow  we need you to go out and get your friends  get your family  get your neighbors  get out and vote for governor matt bevin and all of these great republicans  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress  2020  we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity  these people are on the run  and i will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand  and don't forget  out of 194  we got 194  not one republican left us last week  and two republicans  think of that  and the other three couldn't get there because of  but they were votes  they said they were totally votes  had airport problems  i said  you can't do that  airport problems  but then we had the democrats  we picked up two democrats  so we had bipartisan support  that's unusual  i always say because they're lousy politicians  they've got lousy policy  but they do stick together  that's about it  we will elect a republican congress in 2020  and we'll have a great speaker of the house in kevin  we're going to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  we'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words ""made in the usa""  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending  listen to this  the aids epidemic in america within less than 10 years  we've already started  who would have felt we could have done that  we've started  in the past administration toward the end  we had certain things that we could have done  they didn't do anything  they didn't do anything  but we did  we have it all funded and we started  think of that  aids within 10 years will be out of this country  nobody would have thought that was possible  we will end it  great  great  i came into my office  they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made  it's incredible what they're doing  and don't forget right to try  by the way  where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines  which they were never allowed to in the past  so instead of traveling to asia and europe and all over the world  or going home hopeless and dying  they can now use what we call right to try  we have the greatest doctors  the greatest drugs  greatest labs in the world  they can now go and try  and we are having unbelievable success  unbelievable  right to try  we will chart a new era of discovery in space  and someday soon we will land on  believe it or not  the surface of the moon only to go to mars  you know i said we've done the moon  no  they say  sir  we land on the moon to go to mars  and that's what we're doing with the moon  and we are really  really advanced  it's moving along rapidly  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and above all  we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy  are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  loyal citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  the great state of kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth  these tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a

17,14,Jan,2020,datasets/Milwaukee,"well thank you very much  and i'm thrilled to be back in wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago  you remember that very big night  remember that  they said  ""donald trump has won the state of wisconsin "" and since then we've produced everything we said and more and more  before it was talk  i said  ""i'm going to do this  we're going to take care of your trade "" what we've done with china now  on wednesday we signed  that's tomorrow  what we've done with the us mca  what we've done with japan   40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers  south korea  oh  you got to love trump  you got to love trump  and you're great green bay packers are playing san francisco this weekend  good luck  so do we have any green bay packer fans here tonight  that's right  and you have a great quarterback who's a good guy  a good guy  as we begin the year  our economy is booming  wages are rising  poverty is plummeting  crime is falling and america is the envy of the entire world  and then our opponents say  ""we're not going to win  let's impeach president trump  let's impeach him "" we've got the greatest economy in our history  our military has been totally rebuilt  ""let's impeach him "" but we've created 7 million jobs since the election  including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs  nobody thought that was possible  and we will soon be replacing the nafta catastrophe  one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world  frankly with the incredible us mca  canada  mexico  a giant victory for wisconsin workers  farmers and dairy producers  a tremendous victory  and we may get that all taken care of this week or next week  it just needs one more vote and we'll get that out of the republican senate  the republican senate will be great  tomorrow we'll also be signing our phase one trade deal with china  massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of wisconsin  so after years of devastating defense cuts  we have fully rebuilt the united states military to a point that it has never been before and it's now more advanced  more lethal  and more powerful than ever  and last year  our great american warriors  because that's what they are  and they love it  i got to tell you  they love it  right  they love doing that  they wouldn't trade places with me under any circumstances  they wouldn't trade places with all of our great wisconsin politicians  they want to be a military warrior and we don't want them for that  we want them doing what they're doing  but our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of isis  the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed  and i will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago  isis was all over the place  now the caliphate is 100% destroyed  do you remember when i wanted to leave when it was at 98%  i said  let some of the other countries finish it off  we're going home  right  they all said  ""oh  no sir  please finish it "" so we finished it off to 100%  a few days ago  we took bold and decisive action to defend american lives and deliver american justice  at my direction  the united states military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist  number one terrorist  do you know who that is  qasem soleimani  number one terrorist in the world  soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans and was actively planning new attacks  but we stopped them cold  and frankly  they already started the attack  as you saw in baghdad  on our very large embassy in baghdad  that was already started  and i said to our generals  ""get there now  we don't want to have another benghazi  not on my watch  or on any watch "" they said  ""sir  we'll be there tomorrow "" i said  ""nope  you got to be there right now  get them over there now "" there are thousands of soldiers  they were soldiers  you take a look at that crowd  that was not protesters  they were soldiers  and they were surrounding our embassy in baghdad  and all of a sudden they see these beautiful  very expensive  i will tell you  brand new apache helicopters roaming over the top  and then they see our great military  you saw them in the plane  right  some of them were getting out of their pajamas  they were  i said  ""don't worry about it "" i said  ""we won't put that on "" but they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane  right  and it was a beautiful sight  and these guys were better than tom cruise at his best   protestors disturb the rally  one protester  a very weak voice  if you people wouldn't go crazy every time you see something  he'd go right through and nobody would even know she was there  now she's going home to mom where she will be in big trouble  because i guarantee you that mom voted for trump  and in 10 years from now  when i run yet again  she'll be voting for trump too  i'm only kidding  i'm only kidding  we drive them crazy  we drive them crazy  they say  ""you know he's not leaving  don't you  he's never leaving "" they say  ""he's going to win  he's never going to leave "" these people  it's called trump derangement syndrome  it really is  you know what they don't know is that if for any reason  after five years we do leave  which we will  because i believe in that stuff  right  but you know what's going to happen to their industry  they're all going to die and fold up  going to be very boring out there  very boring  that's why i say at some point  every single one of them will be endorsing donald trump  but crazy bernie sanders and the washington democrats  by the way  bernie is surging  bernie is surging  bernie  but the democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death  that's two  hey  speaking of protesters  have you seen what's happened in iran  the protesters are on our side  first time ever  they're on our side  in fact  they put this big american flag on the street  and the iranians  thousands and thousands of iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it  every one of them went around that flag  they like trump  they like you  i'm just your representative  but they like us  they like us  they haven't seen anything like that in a long time  they went around  did you see it  they went around the flag  they didn't want to touch it  they love america  they love our country  that's called progress  that's called progress  but the democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster  many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms  without legs and without 窶ｦ were done by soleimani  that's what he loved  he loved the roadside bomb  that's what he loved  thousands and thousands and thousands in iraq  in afghanistan  roadside bombs  he was the king of the roadside bombs  great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch  now the democrats should be outraged by soleimani's evil crimes  not that decision to end his wretched life  they're saying  ""well  he was a general  he was this  he was that "" you know what  number one  he wasn't supposed to be there  he was a designated terrorist by president obama who didn't do anything about it as usual  as usual  they don't do anything  they designate and they don't do anything about  he should've been killed 20 years ago  now  here's the story with the democrats  if i didn't kill him  and let's say we lost three  four  five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed  they would have said  ""trump should have taken him out "" anything we do  they go the opposite  so we kill him  and that was precision  some people thought it went much too fast  went too fast  so we kill him and they say  ""what a horrible 窶ｦ"" if we didn't kill him  they'd say  ""what a horrible thing "" right  and by the way  they think they caught me  they never catch us  because mexico's paying for the wall  you know that  you'll see that  it's all worked out  mexico's paying  it's driving them crazy  now they say  ""okay  he's building the wall  but mexico didn't pay "" mexico will pay  and here's the thing  you'll see that it'll come out  we'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before  our debate  the real debate that people are going to watch  because nobody's watching  haven't been doing great on the debates  i have to tell you  but we are building this wall  we're over 100 miles right now  we're going to be expanding the length  you have a lot of natural where you have 1 978 miles  you need 500 miles  but 700 would be good  750 or so would be great  we're going to now get it up  we have all the financing  you think it's easy getting financing when people put 窶ｦ i can get anything from them  i can get whatever i want in terms of money except for a wall  and i made one big mistake  i should have said to them  ""we will not build the wall  we don't want the wall "" they would have insisted that we build it  we would have had all the money we wanted  i made a mistake  i made a big mistake  now we're building the wall  it's going up and it's going up rapidly and very soon we'll be building about a mile a day  and we should be up to over 400 miles by next year  the end of next year  and shortly thereafter it'll be finished  and it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country  bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country  nor do they want to  i think  according to elizabeth pocahontas warren  who has somewhat less indian blood in her than i do  and i have none  remember  oh  we hit her hard  but i hit her too early  but now it doesn't matter  she's not going anywhere  but bernie said  according to her  bernie said  and i don't believe that he said this  because i don't know him  i don't particularly like him  he's a nasty guy  but i don't believe he said it  it's not his field  you have to know what people say  she said  right  that bernie stated strongly that a woman can't win for president  a woman can win for president  fortunately that could happen  who knows  but she said that bernie said  ""a woman can't win "" i don't believe that bernie said that  i really don't know  just it's not the kind of a thing he'd say  if you want to keep america safe  just vote republican  we're doing so well  we're doing so well  now this was 窶ｦ leave him alone  that's all right  let security just take care of her  okay  you all right  get him out here  good  good job security  good job  do we love law enforcement  and is there ever  ever a better place to be than a trump rally on some night during some week  the truth  is we have a great time  but you know what  more importantly we get things done  we're getting everything done  but even president obama's own former national security advisor  a highly respected general named jim jones  praised our action to take out soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do  i'm sure they like him very much  he sounds like our kind of a guy  so jim  if they've given you a hard time  come on over to the republican party  no  he's a respected guy  he said we did the right thing  everyone knows  they're saying  ""was the attack eminent  was it eminent "" does the fact that he's killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands  that doesn't matter  was the attack eminent  i think they're going to start a new investigation  was the attack or this horror 窶ｦ and by the way  he was in a country he wasn't allowed to be in  we don't mention that because he was designated and he wasn't allowed to be there  and he was there with the head of hezbollah  and they were talking about  like hillary clinton  they were talking about weddings and working out  soleimani and the head of hezbollah  they were talking about weddings  working out  or bill clinton in the back of the airplane with the attorney general  where they may have made her an offer that you're going to go to the supreme court  or they may have said  ""you're going to to stay attorney general  but help  help "" they may have said that  do you think they would have said that  no  nothing like that  but do you remember  they talked about golf and grandchildren  right  45 minutes  i like golf  45 minutes  i like golf and i love my grandchildren  i don't think i can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that i don't even know  45  i have a beautiful grandchild  he's really beautiful  he's so great  okay  what else am i going to say  right  then i took a窶ｦ let's talk one or two  how's tiger doing  how's this one  how's that one  that's another five minutes  right  what am i going to do with the other 35 minutes  maybe i'm going to talk about supreme court appointments  et cetera  got zero  he got zero out of it  he got zero  i'd love to have that money back  it's a lot of money  but i've warned the ayatollah and the government of iran that they must not harm  hurt  or kill any protesters  the whole world is watching  it's watching  they've killed thousands of protests  we support the iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom  it's incredible what's going on over there  it really is  but we're watching it  we're watching very closely  and we were ready  that night when the attack was made on us  attack was made on us  remember this  they killed an american  they killed other people just before that  and so we did what we did  right  and they said  it's our turn now  i said  you better be careful when you say it's our turn  because we had designated targets that you wouldn't know窶ｦ it would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible  it's true  it's true  and we saw those missiles launched  and they were big and they were fast  and they were accurate  four of them went bad  they fell way short  but 12 of them hit  and i said  man  they are quick  they knew immediately what they were  and they saw those missiles hit  i said  how bad is it  it hit a base  and an hour later or so  we get a call back  i said  how many killed  nobody  sir  i said  how many hurt  they said  nobody  sir  and i said  they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives  that's true  a trillion  not a billion  a trillion  so they did a very smart thing and we're not looking for regime change  they've tried that with libya  they go  hillary clinton  let's get rid of libya  let's get rid of gaddafi  let's get rid of gaddafi  how's that working out  right  let's get rid of gaddafi  that was a hillary deal  then you had benghazi  and see benghazi  they didn't respond  they didn't respond  should be  should be to iraq  iraq didn't knock down the world trade center just in case anybody had any question  and this guy did kill  he was not a sweetheart  he was a bad guy in every way  but he did kill terrorists  right  and it became harvard university for terrorists  right  but they did go after him  but he didn't knock down out  you know what i did with the soldiers  they don't tell you the truth  sorry  because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there  i told turkey  you got to defend your own border  we're not going to defend your border  and we get along with turkey  we get along  but they've been there for窶ｦ and by the way  i call it a safe zone  that is the most dangerous safe zone in the world  okay  i'm looking at the audience  there's about three of you that want to be in that zone  okay  and you're very tough people  but this is the most dangerous窶ｦ i call it  i call it the safe zone  some day it may be a safe zone  but i took our soldiers out  because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here  and they were going to fight  i said  if they're going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years  for centuries  let them fight  but we're getting the hell out of there  okay  but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story  but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story  because what i did is i took our soldiers  and you know what i did  i moved them to the oil area  and we now control the oil  so they said trump stayed in syria  trump said  so people said to me  why you staying in syria  okay  a long time ago  you have no idea the things and the decisions i've seen  so they say trump's in syria  i didn't pull out  i did pull out  we have the oil really secure  we'll see what happens with it  but we can help our friends  the kurds  because that's where they got their wealth  and then ultimately it was with isis  but right now it's with the united states military  and we also got rid of remnants of isis  while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists  democrats in congress are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way  from the day i came down the escalator with our future first lady  somebody said to me recently  president  president  it was a friend of mine  used to always call me donald  hey donald  how are you doing  let's go have dinner  okay  okay  good  now he calls me president  i told you this before  calls me pres窶ｦ they always call me president  president  president  tell me what's happening  what's going on  how's it all going  you're doing such a great job  i said  do me a favor  call me donald  i can't  now when they say  you know what that means  right  that means respect for the office of president  and you know what  we're going to keep that way  we're going to keep it that way  we're going to keep it there  but that's why this november we're going back and we're going to win the house  the republicans are going to win the house  because i don't know if you know it  the impeachment hoax  it's a total hoax  this is based窶ｦ just think of this  this is based on a perfect phone call  did anybody read the transcript  it's a perfect call  in fact  if you go back and look at lyndon johnson  all of them  lyndon johnson was sort of a tough guy  can you imagine his phone calls  he's probably looking down or looking up  and he's probably saying  these people have gone crazy  that's the nicest call i've ever tracked  somebody said  i never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call  but this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of ukraine said there was no pressure on us  didn't even know what they were talking about  the foreign minister said they want to impeach  impeach the president of the united states over a perfect phone call  it's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country  ever  i don't know if you've seen  independent voters and voters i think of all of the voters  including democrats moving over  we just got a 195 to nothing  the republicans in the house  which was a fix  nancy pelosi says it must be nonpartisan  and she said  it has to be clear cut  well  number one  never happened  no problem  number two  look at the vote  three democrats voted with us  so i guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us  okay  but we're going back and we're going to hold the senate  and we're going to keep the white house  but we're going to win back the house  we're going to win back the house  and i'm thrilled tonight  a man who has become a great friend of mine  he's a warrior  senator ron johnson is here  come up here  what a good guy  congressman bryan steil  jim sensenbrenner  glenn grothman  glenn  come up  come up  mike gallagher  wisconsin house speaker robin voss  wisconsin state senate president roger roth  state senate president  come on fellas  wisconsin state senate majority leader scott fitzgerald  a friend of mine  a world champion  would you believe it  is sean here  where's sean  where's sean  get up here  i love champions  he would climb that sucker  he was the best in the world right here from wisconsin  right  congressman sean duffy  we miss him  but he signed with cnn  they paid him a lot of money  and they don't put them on  why  because i'm pro-trump  you think that's fair  right  he's pro-trump  so what they've done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice  great job  yeah  i like that kind of a job  i think he's okay with it  he gets his check  they refuse to put him on  he says good things about trump  we don't want you on  that's cnn  that's how fake right there  turn the camera on  and a good friend of all of ours  a kenosha native  reince priebus  reince  come up  thank you  man  thank you reince  this is a great group of republican people  but more importantly  it's a great group of winners  they have been so great  so they worked so hard and i just want to thank you all for being here tonight  thank you  thank you ron  a great guy  thanks to strong republican leadership like ron  like all of them that you just saw  america is winning again  america is respected again  and america is thriving again like never before  we're doing great  we're the envy of the world  and under my administration  we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country  and in your great state  wisconsin窶ｦ you ever noticed with biden  he's always calling the wrong state  and in your great state of iowa  iowa  it's iowa  right  no  it's wisconsin  oh  i meant wisconsin  oh  i didn't know i was in wisconsin  that's fine  how many times has he done that  by the way  lots of times  he said  it's great to be in the state of ohio  no sir  you're in florida  many times  the sad part about that窶ｦ sleepy joe is right  you know the sad part about that  when you do that  you can't really recover  you can be winston churchill  make the finest remainder of remarks  but you get killed  and he does it every time  and the fake news  they give him a total pass and that's okay  it's all right  it's going to happen to all of us someday  does anybody get that  yeah  in wisconsin  the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history  how's that for a sound bite  how do you beat that sound bite  right  so now the people of wisconsin are going to say  well let's see the state set a record  most successful it's ever been  and by the way  that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named scott walker  your governor  ron johnson  all those guys  because this didn't happen so quickly  but think  so how do you beat that  you have the most successful  lowest unemployment rate you've ever had  and then they say  somebody's going to come and say  well we'll do a better job  really  you're going to do a better job  the lowest in history by far  your number one economic numbers by far  oh  let's put somebody else in as president  i don't think so  right  but here's one that i loved the most  african american  hispanic american  asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country  and here's another one  african american youth  the way it was was so high was so horrible  youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history  african-american poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also  the only question are you at 70  80  90  97%  he goes higher  what are you at  what's yours  100%  not bad  i know who he's voting for  but think of this  because this is what it's about  is that these companies  these big public companies  they're owned by the people  they're owned by everybody  rich people  and they're owned by everybody  we have set 141 records on the stock market  highest levels ever in recorded history  141 records  that means  in less than three years  for 141 days  we set a record  think of it  we've said 141 records  who the hell can do that  and if our opponents had won the election  instead of going up  we're very close to 30 000 on the dow  nobody thought that was possible  and clearly the fakers back there  nobody thought that was possible  instead of being up  you would have窶ｦ i believe  i really believe  because regulation  so important  tax cuts  so important to get it all going  i believe instead of being up massively  whatever the number is  but depending on who you are  changes  but it's all way over 60  70  80  you guys know  you would have been down 50  60  70  you would have been down at a level  you would probably be extremely depressed  right now  you wouldn't have bought all those brand new keep america great hats  don't worry  we're never getting rid of maga  don't worry  we don't have the courage to get rid of maga  the greatest campaign in history  we're never leaving  but you wouldn't have bought those hats  you know why  you wouldn't have the money to buy him  okay  now you can buy them  it doesn't mean a damn thing  so let's do it real fast  the poll  right  make america great again  or keep america great  right  i don't have to go through the whole deal  we're going to do it quick  we're going to do it quickly  ready  who likes make america great again  whoa  they're very loyal people in wisconsin  who likes keep america great  all right  so it surprises me every single time  but make america great again  maga  has never won one of these polls  you know why  we've rebuilt our military  we've cut taxes  we've cut regulation  our stock market hit records  it's called keep america great  i mean  we've done so much  and i just got a free窶ｦ see these democrats  they go out and spend  1 million on a poll  what i do is i take my own poll  and they'll interview 203 people  203 people say they'll get it wrong  because i'm always surprised  make america great again i think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics  right  but under the trump economy  the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest  fastest  and largest games  you know that right  this is a blue collar boom  they don't like telling you that  under my administration  the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations  that's pretty amazing  because they keep saying  oh  the rich are getting richer  well  the poor are doing the best they've ever done  earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% proportionately  under eight years of the barack hussein obama administration  which administration loves spying on people's campaigns  by the way  by the way  could you imagine if it were the other way around and i spied on his campaign  what would these fake news people be doing  more than 300 000 people under obama  300 000 people left the workforce  under just three years of by administration  3 5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible  370 companies have signed our pledge to america's workers providing more than 14 million americans with new training and job opportunities  we're training them  we're getting them  walmart  so many great companies  they're training people  because they can train a much better than government  14 million  you know who has worked so hard on that  everybody  you've heard of ivanka  right  ivanka  she had such a passion for it  she's very smart  i said  would you like this  you have no debt  i want to get people working  i want to get them and help families  so i said  all right  good  look  she's smart  go do whatever the hell you want to do  it's okay  darling  so she had a goal of a half a million people  she was going to get trained  get into companies  so she'd call walmart  she'd call exxon  she'd call all these great companies  and all of a sudden she hit 8 million  then she hit 9 million  don't forget  she wanted to do 500 000  but this is her  then she had 10 million  she just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies  14 million  ivanka  14 million  would you believe that's possible  but that's why we have the best unemployment rates  we have the best employment rates  by the way  very close to 160 million people are now working in the united states  nobody's ever even come close to that number  we've lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs  real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country  think of that  real median income  under eight years  so we're here three years right  but really less because when it was done  the stats  it was two and a half  but we have less than three  under eight years of the bush administration  household incomes grew  400  eight years   400  under eight years of president obama  household incomes grew  975 000  that's okay  975  eight years  right  under three years of the trump administration  household incomes have risen  10 000  ten thousand  that's why we're doing well  the consumer   3 100 of which for regulatory cuts   2 000 for the tax cuts  it's actually higher than that   2 500 for energy savings  and  5 000 in real wage gains   10 000  the child tax credit alone  which every democrat in congress opposed  is delivering  2 200 a year to the average american family  who's in favor of that cut  who's in favor of having that  you  people don't know  they think the democrats gave it  the democrats give nothing  they're too busy  they're too busy doing other things  they don't do anything  they're too busy doing other things  we ended the war on american energy  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth  number one in the world by far  saudi arabia  russia  but we're number one by far  and if i get a couple of additional pipelines approved  which i will very quickly  instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved  it'll increase this by another 22% that will get them done quickly  and they'll be environmentally friendly and all of that  i believe in that  we have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations  i brought back the old light bulb  better light for much less money  if you want it  right  little things  somebody said  oh sir  don't mention the light bulb  it's hard to make an elegant speech  i'm saying i brought back the light bulb  so the new light bulb costs you five times as much  and it makes you look orange  and i was more interested in the orange than i was in the cost  but you know what  if you want  you have it  and the new bulb  i don't know if you see it  it's on there  it's a hazardous waste  when that bulb ends  you're supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it's loaded up with gasses  that's the new窶ｦ i said to somebody today in environmental protection  how many people do that in the country  sir  maybe none  they throw it into the garbage can  and it's窶ｦ wait  and it was just announced from south korea  makes a lot of our products  unfortunately  i put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators  right  they just announced that they're building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the united states  you know why  you know why  because they don't want to pay the 25% tariff  so they're building them here  that way they don't have to pay the tariff  and just one final thing  i know this doesn't matter  but i said leave it  it's so inelegant to- i know this doesn't matter  but i said leave it  it's so inelegant to talk about it  right  right  isn't it inelegant  i'm talking about dishwashers  wait till you hear the next one  i'm talking about refrigerators  probably wanting to say to the union  i'll leave it out because i want to get praise for making a 窶ｦ you cannot make a brilliant speech where they say  ""that was such an incredible  elegant speech "" if i'm talking about dishwashers  sinks  toilets  light bulbs  but sinks  toilets and showers  you don't get any water  they put restrictors on and now they made them permanent  people used to take them out  they put restrictors on  try going and buying a new faucet  you turn it on  no water comes out  right  we won't talk about toilets  but you know that's 窶ｦ 10  15  but we don't talk about that  because i've said this three or four times  the only subject they ever talk about is toilets  so i don't mention 窶ｦ but how about the shower  you go into a shower  and i have this beautiful head of hair  i need a lot of water  i need water  you go into the shower  right  you turn on the water  drip  drip  drip  i called the guy  ""something wrong with this "" ""no  sir  it's just the restrictor "" so you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be  you use probably more water and it's a very unpleasant experience  right  so we're getting rid of the restrictors  you're going to have full shower flow  full sink  did you ever go to the faucet  you turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy  it's like this  because there's zero pressure behind it  no water  you go like that  the thing flips on  whoa  and then  dung  dung  these people are crazy  and then in california  this governor  who has no clue by the way  he has no clue  governor gavin newsom  he sends all the water out to the pacific and then he just comes up 窶ｦ i don't know if you saw this  they come up with rules and regulations  starting soon  if you're a person lives in california  you only get 50 gallons of water  now  it sounds like a lot of water  but it's not  if you take a shower  wash your hands a couple of times a day 窶ｦ it's not  then it goes down to 47  46  45  can you imagine  you pay the highest taxes outside of new york  where they're not doing a good job in new york  they're not doing good  everyone's leaving new york for other environs like florida  it's not good  because the taxes are too high  governor cuomo's got to get those taxes down  got to get them down  and other things have to happen  but here's gavin newsom  so  gavin newsom  you have the water pouring down from up north  millions and millions of gallons  you know what they do with it  they divert it into the pacific ocean  because they have 窶ｦ we must be in wisconsin  no  millions of gallons coming down from the north  they have this massive valve  you're talking about a valve  this is a serious valve  and they turn it and it 窶ｦ because they have a tiny  tiny little fish that's doing very poorly with or without the water  so in the meantime  if you own a home on beverly hills  they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit  right  but you have no water coming in  they divert millions and millions of gallons  and what we've just done for the people of california is we've made it possible on a federal basis that they don't have to divert all that water anymore  now that's only good for california  but these are the things we do  and now the last one is we're working on cars  we're making them less expensive and safer  we're giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you're going to save on average  3 500  you're going to have a heavier car  a little bit  meaning you'll have steel instead of paper mache walls  and we're getting a lot of good response  and environmentally  it's better  because now people 窶ｦ the number is 12  from 12 years ago  with the old gas guzzlers  they'll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars  which they don't do right now  so it's really going to be something  and we're in a little fight with california over that  but i think ultimately we win that one  you'll buy a better car  a safer car  for less money  not a bad combination  not a bad thing  to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most  we've created opportunity zones  jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in wisconsin  and ron johnson helped and tim scott of south carolina helped  right  they're doing great  they are doing good  and for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend wisconsin workers  but then they went to washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away  countries that you've never even heard of  globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories  steal your farms  by the way  no estate tax on those beautiful farms  we got rid of that  so now  if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch  or even a large ranch  you have no estate tax  you can give it to the kids  if you don't love your children 窶ｦ anybody in here does not love their children  there are some  come on  raise your hand  there are some  you know  they're brats  they're little brats  they're horrible human beings  so if you're one of them  this doesn't help you  because you'll save some tax  the fact is  no estate tax on these small businesses and farms  that's a tremendous thing  because you are dying  you are leaving the business to your kids  they all said  ""thank you very much  daddy and mommy "" and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks  but we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things  little stuff like that we've done that we never said we were going to do  but these people were ransacking your communities  but we are defenseless no more  because at long last you have a president who puts america first  been a long time  been a long time  been a long time  we're putting america first  no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly betrayed the american people than that of immigration  he goes  ""traitor "" are you having a good time  sir  i think you are  goes  ""traitor "" i guess in a certain way they are traitors  when you think about it  left wing politicians  i call them the do nothing democrats  support deadly sanctuary cities  demonstrating their contempt  scorn and disdain for everyday americans  these jurisdictions release dangerous  violent  criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob  attack and murder american citizens  you have it right here  you have it right here  last year  ice 窶ｦ i love ice  i think they're so great  you know  they moved thousands of ms-13 out of our country  thousands  and others too  but ice officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7 000 illegal aliens with criminal records  so you have 7 000 illegal aliens having criminal records  including those charged or convicted of murder  burglary  robbery  drug crimes  killings in the most violent way  right here in wisconsin  cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse  assault and threaten innocent children  your children  last year  a place i like  the sanctuary county of milwaukee  released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child  think of that  of children  he's now at large  they're searching all over and he's looking for yet another victim  they're searching all over  allowed to go from your sanctuary city  in the city of madison  police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault  after authorities released him  he committed violent battery  only to be released one more time  they're looking for him again  isn't that nice  the same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in september and charged with multiple sexual assaults  including sexual assault of a child  now that criminal is once again in wisconsin jail and i call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ice to ensure he is deported the hell back home  get him out of our country  democrats stand for crime  corruption and chaos  republicans stand for law  order and justice  it's true  it's true  we believe wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding americans  not for criminal aliens  we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back  we made a deal with guatemala  honduras  el salvador  mexico  where they accept them back  under the obama administration  they get them  they bring them back  and honduras and guatemala  which they get that  we're not taking them back  but with us  they take them back  they take them back  very great  it helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year  think of it  i just said  we're not paying them anymore  all of a sudden they said  ""we would love to have our wonderful gang members back  we would love to have our gang members back  sir "" thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings  seven straight months in a row  and we're being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall  illegal crossings are down 78% since may and we have ended catch and release  that was a tough one  our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we're fully financed now  isn't that nice  that wasn't easy  that was not easy  we're adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall  you're going to have a wall like no other  it's going to be a powerful  terrific wall  and walls do work  i hate to say  remember the democrats  ""you don't need walls "" oh really  ""we need drones "" they wanted us to put drones flying around  taking pictures of everybody  now  did you see on part of the new wall two days ago  illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall  they got to the top  you know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor  it's very slippery and very hot  very hot  and they got stuck on the wall  they couldn't get off the wall  did you see that  i was watching the news  i was surprised that the fake news showed it and i said  ""isn't that a beautiful sight "" they couldn't get over the wall  couldn't get off  they had to get the fire department to get them down  do you believe that  30 feet up  that's like almost a four story building  washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are now  they're going crazy  they're going totally loony  nervous nancy  how about nervous 窶ｦ how about her district  her district is so filthy dirty  it's filthy dirty with all of the things  i won't say it  but the needles and everything else  these are areas that were  10 years ago  the best in the country and now they're disgusting  she ought to spend more time back in san francisco taking care of her community  instead of wasting everybody's time  but taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders  aoc  all these people  liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million americans of their private health insurance  many of you have great insurance  republicans will never let that happen  they'll probably change their mind before the 窶ｦ see  this is why i don't like talking about it now  i'd rather wait six  seven  eight months  let them say it 5  000 times when they have to do it  and then talk extreme late term abortion  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god won five times "" i said  ""i've done one  but i've won  but it's the beep "" but no  seriously  we're all smart people  how is it good when they say  ""we're going to raise your taxes "" is the world going crazy  they say  ""we're going to raise your taxes  we're going to open borders  everybody can come in 窶ｦ for everybody's health insurance  schooling  you know  one time 窶ｦ we're going to get everybody a rolls royce  and cnn or one of them said  ""they never said  and they never promised a rolls royce  donald trump lied tonight "" i said  ""every illegal alien will have a rolls royce "" they said  ""he lied tonight "" these people are sick  but they're the party of late term abortion  socialism and corruption  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  and of course  honest abe lincoln  right  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race  religion  color  and creed  we are a movement  there's a movement like nobody's ever seen before  you know  when i mention this  anything i say that's even slightly false  it's headlines  ""trump said this  these people  he said this "" this is one of the greatest 窶ｦ i would say this  this is the greatest movement in the history of our country  i really believe that  never been a movement like this  i mean  there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of new hampshire  won iowa  won south carolina down the way  won a state some place  but we won 32 states  there's never been a movement like this  never happened before  but we're a movement for all americans who believe in fairness and justice  equality and dignity  opportunity and safety  we are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future  that's why african americans are joining the republican party like nobody ever thought even possible  they love us and we love them  and to give former prisoners a second chance at life  we passed  it was us  not the democrats  they came to me  they wanted help  i gave them help  i got it done  i called republicans that maybe wouldn't have been so inclined  some of them  some of them very much inclined  some of them very conservative were very much inclined  but i got the people that we needed  obama couldn't do it  bush couldn't do it  nobody could do it  i got it approved  and from the day it was approved  i got no thanks  i got no credit  and that's okay  because you know  right  but we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that's helped so many people  i mean  you know the story of alice johnson  you know so many different stories  it's helped so many people  especially in the african-american community  the hispanic community  it's helped a lot of people  it's a different world  to uphold the rule of law  we have confirmed 187 federal judges  a record  who will interpret the constitution as written  187  last spring  wisconsin voters  as you know  elected a great judge to your state supreme court  and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge  justice daniel kelly  go vote for justice daniel kelly to defend the rule of law in wisconsin  daniel kelly  we are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great 窶ｦ look  until you get rid of it  you never did great  but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible  in 2018  drug overdose deaths  the overdose deaths  fell for the first time in decades  including by 10% in

to do it  people are dying  got to do it "" they're doing it  we are fighting very hard for school choice and it's moving along well in wisconsin  milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools  and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in america who needs it  as we continue rebuilding our military  workers are building brand new humvee replacements 窶ｦ you know about that 窶ｦ in oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in marinette  a lot of ships  a lot of humvees  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  something they've been trying to get for 52 years  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for you  the people of wisconsin  at stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation  what these people are doing  they will destroy our nation  they will destroy our nation  and our last election was so important  i don't know  maybe the most important ever  but it was so important  i really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important  i can't say more  but just as important  because we need time for that tree to grow  you plant a tree and it takes time  we need time for that tree to grow  and we have other things that we want to do  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020  have to do it  only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  and i have found out what a swamp it is  bad people  i have become the expert all what a swamp  you know  when i used to say  ""drain the swamp "" i had no idea it would be that bad  but we're

independence  and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  which now we're already doing  we're already doing a lot of it  you've got to get loopholes  you know  you need their votes  we have loopholes  like visa lottery  we put names in a lottery and they come in  they become american citizens  do you think these countries are giving us their finest  ""oh  let's give them our best citizens  put them in "" these people are crazy to allow this to happen  so we're stopping it all  but ending catch and release was a very big thing  and we did that with no democrat help  they wouldn't do it  it's called loopholes  who wouldn't want to end loopholes  we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  ""made in the usa "" we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years  who would've thought that  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and above all  we will never stop fighting for

18,12,Sep,2020,datasets/Minden,"well  i thank you very much  so i want to start by saying  ""hello  nevada  how are you doing  how are you "" and i'm thrilled to be in douglas county  but people are coming from all over the place  there's a lot of people for douglas county  isn't it  we have thousands and thousands of loyal  hardworking american patriots  that's what we have  and 52 days from now  we're going to win nevada  and we're going to win four more years in the white house  and then after that we'll negotiate  right  窶呂ause we're probably  based on the way we were treated  we're probably entitled to another four after that  and it should never happen to another president  that's just a dishonest group of people  but here we are  and we're going to be here for another four years  the governor of your state- 窶ｦ tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight  he didn't like us having窶ｦ they can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that's okay  you can burn up the house  that's okay  we call this a protest because if you call it a protest  you're allowed to have it  it's okay  so if anybody asks you outside  this is called a friendly protest  okay  it's true  you can't have political rallies  that's because of me  because if biden were here  he'd have about three people  do you ever see him with his little circles  the circle  you know why he puts the circles  because he wants to be like correct with covid  but it's not really because they can't get anybody to fill up a room  so they put these big circles  so he can't get anybody to fill  nobody wants to go  oh  boy  the fake news  look at all those people back there  the fakers  that's true  boy  they covered  did you see the other day  now they're finding out that to do an interview  an interview  they ask him a question  that means they're giving him the questions  they never gave me questions before  so to do an interview  he demands on getting the questions  and his people write out the answer  so they ask him a question  he goes  ""bring it up closer  i can't see it  dammit "" great  this is something  you know  we have a debate coming up in three weeks  and here's the problem  winston churchill  did you ever hear of winston churchill  winston churchill was a great debater  great  and if joe gets off the stage  walks off the stage  if he makes it  which i think he probably will  in all fairness  he's been doing this for 47 years  right  i think he probably will  if he gets off the stage  they're going to say it was the single greatest debate they've ever seen  winston churchill was nothing compared to sleepy joe  you know that  you know that  they're going to say  ""what a great performance  he was great today  he was great  this guy was great "" nah  he's not great  but your governor tried to stop us  he tried to stop us  the governor of nevada  he tried to stop us  and we went to different venues  kelly o'donnell  she's a fading reporter for nbc  do you know that  she was on  she said  ""well  they have a crowd tonight "" behind her  it looked like 25 000 people  that's what we have  by the way  a lot more coming in  but she said  ""he's got maybe a thousand people  a thousand "" you know what i got  i have a thousand people here  no  this is the fake news  you know what  it's not a question of how many窶ｦ they are just a bunch of dishonest people  i've never seen anything like it  being in real estate and being in new york and being in all over  i've seen a lot of dishonest people  i think the media  the fake news is the most dishonest group of people i've ever seen anywhere in my entire life  and that includes  by the way  leaders of foreign countries that aren't our friends  okay  that's a big statement  they really are bad news  but here we are  and this is really amazing  the governor tried to stop us  he couldn't  but think of this  he's in control of millions of votes  here's a guy calling venues  telling them not to have the rally  calling different venues  ""don't have the rally  we're not going to let you have the rally "" and he's calling  this governor who was a political hack  he was a political hack  and then he became governor  and this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots  unsolicited ballots  millions and millions  and then we're supposed to win these states  and we have a guy that would do that where he won't let us have  and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it  but you want to know something  it's a disgrace  so who the hell is going to trust  they say  ""trust government "" well  how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren't here  that we can't have all these thousands of people  boy  you are really back far  that's窶ｦ look at that  no  but seriously  and now he's in charge of the election and the millions of ballots  so if i'm up like millions of votes  he can rig the election  he can rig the election  and i'll tell you what  whether it's in north carolina  whether it's in michigan  whether it's in other states where they're sending out  they're going to be sending out 80 million ballots  and it's democrats  they're trying to rig this election  at every single place in the last year  year and a half  go modern day  forget about窶ｦ tiny amounts  a congressional race in new york  a small number of votes  if you go to new jersey  if you go to virginia  if you go to pennsylvania  if you go to california  look at some of these races  every one of these races was a fraud  missing ballots  and i don't mean like 1%  i mean like 20%  25%  they're trying to rig the election  they should make people  if you register  if you want a solicited ballot  that's where you ask for it  you have to sign papers  you get it because you can't be there  that's one thing  when they send 80 million ballots to people  they have no idea where they're going  actually  they probably do have a good idea where they're going  and that's our problem  they send 80 million ballots out  where are they going  who are they sending them to  are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas  are they sending them to democrat areas  these are all controlled by democrat governors  like your politically motivated governor  so  just to finish on that  look  just to finish on that  he's a guy that tried to silence us by not having this  and it ended up  our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than nbc  which is owned by concast  c-o-n  concast  c-o-n-c-a-s-t  concast  it's really comcast  but i call it con because it's a whole con  i'll tell you what  in the old days  i think it should still be  news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate  right  and they had licensing  today  they can do whatever the hell they want  it's fake news  and it's a disgrace  and you know what  back there  and i'll tell you  it's hurting our country  it's hurting our country  they're the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media  worse than the democrats  because the democrats are their partners  they play together  joe biden spent the last 47 years selling out america  offshoring your jobs  throwing open your borders  depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future in china  i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america  securing our borders  rebuilding our military and standing up to china like never before  nobody has ever stood up to china like we have stood up to china  and you haven't seen the last of it  sleepy joe biden  who surrendered  you know where he is now  he's in his damn basement again  no  he's in his basement  he's in his basement  but i can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that i've ever seen  do you know what i'm talking about  where i'm standing over the graves of our fallen warriors  our fallen heroes  these are great people  the greatest people there are  and i'm standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying  i won't even use the term  but saying bad things  and there's nobody that loves our military  respects it and the people more than me  and they took窶ｦ and i didn't even ask  we had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place  it never took place  what they said  and yet pathetic joe  and he's a pathetic human being to allow that to happen  here's the problem  he doesn't even know what happened  i don't think  i think he has no idea  but he's a pathetic human being to let that happen  where they put an ad like that  where i'm standing over graves  and then they said  ""he said this "" with no sources  no nothing  they got nothing  and i have 25 real witnesses with the names  with everything  saying it never happened  and they put an ad like that up  they're a disgrace  but you know the good part  now i can be really vicious  i can be really vicious  and we'll start by saying  we're going to start by saying that the democrats are trying to rig this election because it's the only way they're going to win  the only way they're going to win is to rig it  biden's surrendered your jobs to china  look  his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars  give me a break  give me a窶ｦ his son's going to say  ""dad  you can't take this money away  don't do it  dad  please  i don't窶ｦ"" you know how much experience he had  there's a young man here  he's a very young  young man  handsome young guy  he's about like 12  you know what  he's got more experience than hunter  hunter  where's hunter  where is he  with no experience  no knowledge of energy  no job  got thrown out of the military窶ｦ you know he got thrown out  by the way  i used to be nice about that  now i don't  once i saw that ad  i don't have to be nice anymore  okay  i really mean it  and by the way  on that ad  i know some horrible people  horrible human beings  some of the worst people in the world  i really do  they're horrible  none of those people  and they're the worst  the worst  real estate developers in new york  you don't get much worse  i know some of the worst people in the world  not one person do i know that would say that  standing on top of graves  of heroes  really  not one person  so i will tell you this  so now we can play it like it is  let's face it  joe is shot  let's face it  okay  he's shot  so not that he has anything to do because he won't know what's happening  he'll just be locked up in a room someplace  and the radical left is going to be running our country  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  thank you  but now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob  you know that  if biden wins  china wins  if biden wins  the mob wins  you see what's going on with all these democratic or i always say democrat-run cities and states  it's a disaster  it's a disaster  and we keep saying  ""let us bring in the troops "" well  we did it in minneapolis  we ended it  in 45 minutes  it was ended  they went through two weeks  by the way  we could do it in portland in half an hour  it would all be over  but we have these stupid people that think窶ｦ how about that poor mayor  is that pathetic  wheeler  is that pathetic  they forced him out of his home  he's now finding a new home  it's so nice  it's pathetic  honestly  it's pathetic  we could solve that problem in a half an hour  just like we did  and by the way  the us marshals did a great job in portland  they did a great job  you know what i mean  if biden wins  the rioters win  the anarchists win  arsonists  flag burners  they all win  i'm running for reelection to bring prosperity to nevada  to the whole country  i've been here a long time  i have some things in nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america  not to china  i do get a kick out of watching a guy  ""oh  i'm going to do this "" he copied my whole plan  you see  he says  ""buy america "" i said  ""where the hell have you been for the last half century "" thank you  could i ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards  all the way back there  take your cameras  go as far as the eye can see  no  no  tell nbc news it's not a thousand people  you can't see it  you can't see it down here  you won't believe how many people  that thing goes back窶ｦ so the bottom line is when we win  america wins  that's what's happening  and nobody's done to china what i did  look  billions  tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in  i gave  28 billion to farmers  the farmers are doing very well  they're doing very well  thank you  thank you  president trump  28 billion  16 billion one year 12 billion  they were targeted  i said  ""how much is it "" sonny perdue  secretary of agriculture  great guy  said  ""how much were they hurt by "" ""sir  12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year "" i said  ""all right  good  we'll take it out of china "" we gave them 28 billion  to the farmers  that never happened before  you think joe biden would even think about it  he wouldn't even think about it  he wouldn't even think about it  no  he's more worried about  does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter's question  the worst part about that isn't the fact that he's doing that  because let's face it  he's unable  okay  it's not that  it's that the fake news would give him the questions  they never gave me the questions  did you ever give me questions  back there  did you ever give me窶ｦ they don't give me questions  the fake news

then she said  ""well  i don't think i did it  i don't remember "" i knew she was in trouble when she said  ""i don't remember doing that  i don't remember "" she didn't remember  oh  okay  well  as long as you don't remember  it's true  it's true too  it's true  you know what  i used to stand back and i'd say  ""be quiet  please  don't say that  it's really not nice "" you know it's true  she deleted 33窶ｦ think of it  they'll never find the emails because they were acid washed  deleted  but you know what  she got a subpoena from the united states congress  right  and she and her lawyer deleted 33 000 emails after she got a united states subpoena  and you say  ""why isn't she guilty of a major crime "" right  and then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer  right  and then she took the other ones  and she deleted them  and now the mueller scam  these people  the worst people  i have a friend  a very smart guy  very streetwise guy  he said  ""you have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations  where they have the worst human beings in the world "" they worked for the democrats  they worked窶ｦ i mean  mueller didn't

don't play it the same way  they're too nice  and we have better policy  thank goodness we have better窶ｦ we believe in borders  we believe in no sanctuary cities  we believe in lowering taxes  we have better  but our people don't窶ｦ we have some that are very good  jim jordan  good  right  jim jordan  mark meadows  good  right  no  we have some very good  but i'll tell you what  we play it so nice  and in the end it's not right because what they get away with窶ｦ and obama and biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence  i put that in quotes  using intelligence to spy on our campaign  and they got caught  they got caught  and if it was me that got caught  forget about it  but they got caught and somebody said  "" well i know  but he was president "" oh great  i'm president too  and a hell of a lot better president than he is  i can tell you that  obama came into office  they gave him the nobel prize  like almost immediately  right  in fact  he didn't even know why he got it  he didn't even know  he had no idea why he got it  and he was right about that because nobody else does either  they still don't know  but we've done a lot of things  so we were nominated a few days ago for a nobel prize  which is a big thing  nobel peace prize  and then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another nobel prize  now  that's a big thing  to me  it's a big thing  even though obviously it's a very political thing  but it's a very big thing  the nobel peace prize  right  i got  it was just reported  i'm just reporting this  i got zero time on the nightly news  on the network news  zero  zero  we got zero time  think of it  the president of your country is honored by being nominated for the nobel peace prize  and your nightly news  abc  which is terrible  cbs  which is terrible  and probably the worst of all owned by concast  they spend a fortune on pr  and then every time i get up  i call them concast and sort of wipe out their fortune  but they are bad people  but nbc is the worst of them all  not one mentioned  these people are corrupt  not one mentioned  not one mentioned  so your president gets a nobel and  at least a nomination  and they don't mention it  joe biden cannot lead our country because he doesn't really believe in our country  right now  i don't think he believes in anything  he just wants to go to sleep  that's all  ""please  darling  i want to go to bed  i'm exhausted  i made one speech yesterday "" ""but darling  they gave you the answers and the questions "" ""i know  but that was a big strain because my eyes  i couldn't see the teleprompter "" this guy is the worst  i am窶ｦ and you know  it's going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election  it's a rigged election  it's the only way we're going to lose  but i'll tell you what  he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential窶ｦ he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics  he doesn't know he's alive  he doesn't know he's alive  and i got to know president xi of china very well  president putin of russia  kim jong-un  by the way  what happened to the war  i thought we was going to war with kim jong-un  where's the war  where's the war  oh  i see  oh  i see  it never happened  did it  never happened  did it  well  maybe some day  could happen  no  remember  ""trump is going to be 窶ｦ "" you know my personality  right  ""trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins "" where's the war in fact  the peace prize was because i stayed out of wars  and by the way  ended certain wars that could have happened that you don't even know about  and look what we did just yesterday in europe  and look what we did with israel  and you just saw that  with united arab emirates  and bahrain  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you very much  thank you very much  now  after this is over  you'll have like at nbc  this third-rate reporter stand up  they had a small crowd  a insignificant crowd  in a great location  you know how great it was  we landed  we had to drive for 50 minutes  that's how great  but i like it anyway  i'll take it  i'll take it anyway  i like it  you're my kind of people  we love each other  i like it  we landed the big  beautiful air force one  i just asked as we're coming in  ""why couldn't we have landed here "" i would have rather  then i could have had the plane right behind me  instead  we have the beast  see the beast  what you don't know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane  it's a hell of a car  it's a walking army tank  the beast  but we could have  i said  ""why don't we just land here "" and we couldn't  so i get off the plane  oh  good  ""how long will it be "" ""about 50 minutes "" that's a long drive  and driving here  there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags  and then you read these fake reporters and they say  ""president trump is tied in nevada  tied "" i don't think so  the only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots  which they will do in my opinion  okay  we're not tied anywhere  i asked some people that traveled with obama  i said  ""was it the same thing "" they say  ""not even a tiny fraction of what you have "" there's not even a fraction  we have more enthusiasm  we have more spirit than any campaign that anybody's ever seen  it's true  and that includes 2016  where the enthusiasm obviously was great  how about all those states that we weren't supposed to win  ""no  he won't win there  he won't win there "" then all night long  ""donald trump won the great state of texas  donald trump won the great state of 窶ｦ "" this and that  and one after another  was that one of the coolest things  watching their people go crazy  they went crazy  no  they went crazy  how is he going to do in georgia  well  i think george is going to be very close  it's going to be very close  they go  ""the polls in georgia have closed  donald trump wins the state of georgia "" you know why  because we won by so much  that they can do it simultaneously by saying  ""the polls closed  and he won "" we had many of them  right  and by the way  we're doing great  i just had 窶ｦ florida is a biggie  a good one  and we are winning in florida by a lot  so that's good  a lot  i'll tell you here  because you don't read about that stuff  they don't like to write that  they don't like to write it  they have all fake polls  i'll tell you what  the polls are worse than the writing  actually  in my opinion  the polls  they're suppression polls  they're meant to make people discouraged  even me  i'm supposed to be discouraged  and fortunately  four years ago  we weren't discouraged  because if we would have believed the polls  nobody would have voted  the concept is really make people feel so that on election  they go  ""darling  let's go out to dinner  it's so sad about the president  i wish he was going to win  but let's go out to dinner  then we'll come home  let's not bother voting  right  let's not bother voting "" see  it's a suppression  but my people might don't get suppressed  my people go out and vote  my people go out and vote  there's no suppression  phony polls  how about the guy  the new york times hired this pollster  this great genius  he never called one wrong  i don't know  three  46  i don't know what the hell 窶ｦ it's called three 40 窶ｦ what's his deal  00  we were given a very tiny chance  what chance did he give us  like 9%  something like that  you know  they gave him millions of dollars shortly before

a lot of places  "" he's even "" well  we're not even  we're not even  this is going to be the greatest victory  this is a more important election than four years ago  i'll tell you  more important  because at no time before  has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions  two philosophies  two agendas for the future  there's never been anything like this  on november 3rd  nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity  like we had  we had the greatest economy in the history 窶ｦ not of our country  in the world  we were beating everybody  we were beating china  remember  if you go back  some of you go back  if you go back 10 years  15 years  five years  everything was 窶ｦ in 2019  china will overtake the united states as the largest economy  and that didn't work out too well for them  that didn't work out  we were just doing leaps and bounds  we were doing so great  and then we got hit with the plague  the china plague  and we're not thrilled  it's a disgrace  nobody should have died  nobody should have died  we got hit  the whole world got hit  but they stopped it from going into the rest of china  they stopped it from going into china  but they didn't stop it from coming into the us and europe and 188 countries  so whether or not we allow biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country   4 trillion  or ban 窶ｦ he wants to ban energy  ban american 窶ｦ he wants to stop fracking  hey  by the way  when he was running as a democrat  in the worst debate performances i've ever seen  okay  what do you think 窶ｦ he was unable to answer anything  are you awake  sir  sir  please wake up  and who was the worst  who treated him the worst  kamala  kamala  she's another beauty  she started off as a favorite  she was at 15  then she went down to 14  to 12  to 10  she was like a dropping rock in water  she was going down so fast  then she went down to five and four and three  two  and then she said  ""i got to get the hell out of here  this is getting embarrassing "" and nobody treated him worse than kamala  right  she called him a racist  she called him everything  she was horrible to him  and he says  ""she was kamala  she's just great "" oh  yeah  these people  these people  you're supposed to choose the people that did well  she got out before iowa  as i remember  right  she didn't want to run in iowa  and then bernie got 窶ｦ again  this guy is the greatest loser ever because- no  no  no  he's a good sport  bernie  crazy bernie  he's so crazy  but he's a good sport  because with hillary  they really did  do we have any young children here  i know it's on a lot of television  could you turn the television off just for a minute  just for about three seconds  he got screwed  right  okay  now you can turn it back on  but then they really did with this last one  because if pocahontas  elizabeth warren  if she would have left the race one day before the big super tuesday  i mean  bernie would have her philosophy  right  liberals  and i would say  she'll be president  if he ever wants  she'll be president within the first month or so  i would say  i think it's just an excuse  using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there  so they can destroy our suburbs  demolish our second amendment  erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous  anti-american lies in school  so under my leadership  we built the greatest economy in the history of the world  and now we're doing it again  we're doing it again  you've seen the numbers  and we're developing a vaccine in record time  it will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that  they're very unhappy about that  it's amazing  we have a couple of really great experts  one who's 窶ｦ we call him dr  scott  you know who i'm talking about  he's great  he said  this is the only time 窶ｦ they were grilling him on television  saying  ""well  the vaccine's going too fast "" you know why that's too fast  because they don't want it to happen before the election  he said  ""this is the only thing in the world  i've never seen anything like it  everybody wants a vaccine  and when we start getting it fast  because president trump happens to be president 窶ｦ "" and we've done this in record time  years ahead of schedule  if this was sleepy joe and obama  you wouldn't have a vaccine for three years  but listen  he said  ""this is the craziest thing "" so you're going to have a vaccine quickly  right  and everybody's upset about it  so now they're trying to hurt the vaccine  and they're trying to say as many bad 窶ｦ they know nothing about it  but they're trying to hurt it  and it's a shame  but he said it better than anybody i've heard  he said  ""you're trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine  because we're going to produce it early "" it's the craziest thing  think about it  now  having a vaccine is good  but we're rounding the turn regardless  we're rounding the turn  and it's happening  i mean  it's happening  you see  florida is way down  texas is now way down  arizona  governor's done a great job  all three governors have done a great job  and louisiana now  they had a spike  but they had the spike  but the spike was able to be handled  because now we understand  and what we did  we saved millions of lives  because i hated to do it  but we had to close it up  understand this disease  and then open up again  and we opened  but we would have had 2 million  two and a half  or three million people  think of it  we're at like around 180 000  one is too many  one  too many  but we would've had two and a half  three  three and a half million people  it would not have been acceptable  would not have been sustainable  we've done an incredible job  and these people that have done it with me  the ventilators  the vaccines  the therapeutics  these people 窶ｦ i mean the hospitals  the beds that we built  the ships that we sent to new york  the ships that we sent  to have an ungrateful governor in new york  cuomo  to have an ungrateful governor  we sent him ships  we sent them ships  we sent them  we built a convention center with 2 800 beds  and he didn't use the beds for senior citizens  he hardly used the beds at all  he hardly used the ships at all  he said we did a phenomenal job  and now he gets political  he wants to get political with me  a real wise guy  but that's okay  you got to see what they are doing between him and de blasio  that's a beauty  what they've done to my beautiful city  i love that city so much  what they've done is so horrible  the highest taxes in the land  crime all over the place  they're like 300% up in crime  we need rudy to come out of retirement  but we're defeating the china virus  when biden was vice president  he was a complete disaster on the swine flu  which was a much easier thing to handle  joe biden's own chief of staff said that when biden managed swine flu in 2009  they quote  ""did every possible thing wrong "" this is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu  and 60 million americans got h1n1 in a period of time  and it's just purely a 窶ｦ he said it was just 窶ｦ we were lucky  he said  ""it's just lucky that there weren't great mass casualties "" different kinds of a disease  a little bit  and what he said is amazing  he said we did nothing right  this is the man that's going to tell us all about building ventilators  you think joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month  which now we're doing  and sending them to all these countries  all over the world  who have no hope of building ventilators  and they need them badly  so it's an amazing thing  the outbreak was so rampant that obama-biden  the administration  told states to stop testing immediately  and they ordered the cdc to stop counting cases because they looked like hell  okay  we didn't do that  by the way  the reason we show so many cases  because we have the best testing program in the world  by far  by far "" biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the china virus arrived  hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died  as vice president  he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the great depression  you've heard that before  it was the most pathetic recovery since the depression  no state was hit harder by biden's failure than nevada  and i was out here and that right about that  you got hit hard  this is not the guy you want  but biden wants to raise your taxes so high  he would eradicate your economy  he'd put on new regulations  and it wouldn't be him again  i'm going to keep saying it  it will be the people that control him  he's a puppet  and then he wants to do a complete shutdown  we're setting records  we just set a job record for four months  10 4 million people  listen to this  so when we had this pandemic worldwide  look  it's a terrible thing that a thing like this happened  people were saying we could go to 41  42% unemployment  you know what we are now  8 4%  i don't say that's 窶ｦ if you would have said that 窶ｦ and we have the strongest  highest stock market in history  so your 401ks are doing great  if he got in  we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country  i mean it  i think 1929 would look like good times  all right  because he'd do everything wrong  he'd raise your taxes  he'd raised the hell out of interest rates  he'd do everything wrong  the biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of americans  inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide  don't forget when you do these shutdowns  your state is shut down  you got a governor  you shut down  except if you have a riot  you're not shut down for riots  riots  you can have  they can burn the hell out of the strip  they can burn the hell out of reno  they can do whatever the hell they want if it's a riot  but if you want to go to church  you can't do it  if you want to be in a group of people  you can't do it  but there's a lot of harm done on the other side  there's a lot of tremendous harm done  remember  the cure can't be worse  remember that  and on the other side  drugs  suicide  depression  substance abuse of different kinds  heart disease  you have tremendous problems on the other side  open your schools  open up  we got to open up this state  and i guarantee you 窶ｦ and by the way  the states that are open are doing really well  they're doing much better than the ones that are closed  i don't know if you've been seeing the numbers  and this is just arithmetic  the states that are open are doing great  the states that are closed  north carolina  what he's doing to that great state  he's got it locked down  shut down  michigan  what she's doing  and we're trying to get big 10 football by the way  but we won't even  michigan  what she's doing to michigan is unbelievable  take a look at what they're doing to pennsylvania  and here's another governor in charge of millions of ballots  so i'm going to win pennsylvania  but what's he going to do with these ballots  where are they going  who are they sending  who's sending it back  who's signing  they don't even have to have an

they'll figure a way  no  they are  it's a very dangerous thing  it's a very dangerous thing  and i totally mean it  and i've been at it  and you see people  and by the way  it's not even politics  it's common sense  they said millions of ballots  people are getting ballots  people died and they're getting ballots  they're sending them to dogs  you see that  dogs got ballot  everybody's getting ballots  probably everybody  but republican are going to get the ballots  right  and they're unsolicited  so when you say  solicited  because i like solicited better as a word than absentee  absentee

you send it back  it's okay  it's good  but unsolicited  where they take millions of ballots  so what happens  i happen to think the postal people are great  but what happens if one of the post guys  before he gives the ballots  he takes a whole handful and hands them to some democrat political operative  right  and so  he hands him a thousand ballots  and the guy doesn't even have to 窶ｦ you don't have to have verification to do that  now  here's the good news  we're in front of a court  and hopefully  the court's going to rule  because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential

out of church  they really do  they're fighting god  they're fighting guns  and they're fighting oil  think of it  i don't think they'll do too well in texas  did you see where they said  ""we think the race will be quite close in texas  but the president has an edge "" listen  i'm in favor of oil and energy  i'm in favor of religion and god  okay  and i'm in favor of our great second amendment  guns  so he's against our second amendment  okay  you know who he'd put in charge  beto  beto  or as he says is  ""beto  beto "" so when beto was legit and then ted cruz beat him  and ted did a very good job  i tell you  he did a great job  but beto went totally south  he's gone crazy  so he now is a big gun guy  he wants to take guns away from everybody  so who did biden put in charge  beto  remember beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine  most of them are  but remember  and beto said  this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell  i said  ""he thought this was easy  didn't he "" but remember when beto said  ""i was born for this "" as soon as i hear somebody's born for running for president  i said  ""he's out  that's the end of him "" nobody's born for this  this is tough stuff  i had a great life  i'll tell you  my life was so beautiful  what the hell did i do this for  but you know what  you know what  we are doing things that nobody's ever done before  and i say it all the time  and that's what makes me happy  we're dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people  but i'll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years  no administration has done what we've done in the first three-and-a-half years  but they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down  look at washington  they want to burn the churches down  and that's fine  but you want to go pray in church  they won't let you do that  just last week  biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal

places were talking about are democrat- run  chicago  new york  portland  seattle  the only reason seattle got settled  because they knew we were going in  we told them  ""we're going in tomorrow morning  we're going to open it up  we're going to take it "" it would have taken us 20 minutes  so they sent people that night  because they didn't want to be embarrassed  but look at what we've done

his government  there are policies biden's pledged to apply nationwide  you're going to have the suburbs  they have a plan  it doesn't matter  it's a regulation  very horrible regulation for the 窶ｦ

let's just amend it "" i said  ""nope  we got to end it  end it  i want to end it  i don't want to have a lesser version "" but if he gets in  they will open up that whole program  they're going to

american dream and they don't want that to happen  that's why i'm doing so well with african american  with asian american  with hispanic american and with women  but don't let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately  immediately  and don't let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place  the suburbs are the american dream  that's where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody  don't let them ruin the suburbs  and with that comes tremendous crime  and i was talking the other day  ""darling  somebody just moved

they live in a basement too  their mom and dad's basement  but biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists  joe biden is a weak person  he does whatever his left wing  puppet masters demand  you know that  look  joe doesn't know what's going on  you know that  i mean  let's be nice about it  okay  and i'm being nice when i say it  he'll never be able to protect your family  your loved ones or your community  if biden's elected his radical supporters won't just cause mayhem on the streets like you're seeing  all democrats  we could solve it so fast  chicago  a few weekends  think of it  72 people shot  this is shot  somebody said  ""you mean with bullets "" i said  ""yeah  with bullets "" 18 people died  now we're pulling our troops out of afghanistan  out of iraq  you see what's happening  but let me tell you but we don't 窶ｦ there's nothing like that over there  they don't have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time  well  you have 70 people shot  where you have another weekend where they had  i think a few weekends ago  38 people have been shot in chicago  i said  38  it's not even believable  and now when these people say it  they make it 窶ｦ they try and play it down  and you're sitting there  i said  ""did i just see 38 people were shot "" it's just a terrible thing  and it could all be stopped  it could all be stopped so quickly  but they have to respect law and they have to have order  law and order  but these radical lefts will be running the department of justice  the department of homeland security and the united states supreme court  and you see what's going on there  if we don't 窶ｦ the next president  hopefully it's going to be us  not me  us  but the next president is going to have one  two  three or four supreme court justice  it's just  you know  just that time  right  just that time  going to be a minimum of one  i would say  but it will be a one  two  three or four  and that's going to change the whole makeup of the supreme court  that's going to take away your guns  that's going to destroy your second amendment  that's going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn't believe  including by the way  life  okay  life  pro-life  anybody pro-life here  no  this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years  i don't know that the country will survive 50 years  if that happens  it might not survive five years if that happens  but the next president and you saw  i put out a list of an additional number of very conservative  highly thought of  highly respected judges  and they are the only people that i will pick  meaning the first list  the second list  it's about 44  45 people  they are the only people that i will consider for the supreme court of the united states  and i'm asking joe biden to do the same thing  but he can't because he's got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court  and nobody can get elected  not even with democrats  rational democrats  will they vote for some of these people to be on  so far he's refused to do it  i'm probably forcing him tonight to do something  but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand  biden supports cutting police funding  you know that  abolishing 窶ｦ and by the way  did you see  we just got chicago police today endorsed trump  that's not easy to do  chicago  new york's finest  new york's finest endorse  florida  ohio  texas  we have everybody  is there a police officer in the country  if there is  they'll do a commercial  this officer loves sleepy joe biden  he's so tough on crime  so biden's been going down very rapidly in the polls  and now what he's doing is he's playing tough guy  that he's tough on crime  and all of a sudden  he goes from demolished  demolish and defund  okay  but he goes from  let's not give the police any money  let's not even say defund for him  his people want to defund the police  they actually have places  seattle  they actually don't want to have police  minneapolis  they don't want to have police  they don't want to have police  what's going to happen  you saw the commercial we put up  a woman's being murdered  ""i'm sorry  we cannot take your call right now  we will call you back within the next 24 hours "" a woman's being raped  right  ""i'm sorry  we could not respond right now because we have been defunded  but we will try getting there within the next week "" this is what you're going to have  i mean  that was a strong commercial  it had a big impact  but this is what you're buying with a guy like this  this guy you're going to have portland's all over this country  and we can't allow that to happen  ""not here "" he says  ""not here in nevada "" well with your governor  it could happen here too  i can tell  they want to abolish bail  so they want to abolish cash bail like they did in new york  they release people  the horrible criminals in new york  they release them  no cash bail  and he calls law enforcement  biden called law enforcement the enemy  they're not the enemy  they're our friends  they're our great friends  and without them  we wouldn't be here  here in nevada rioters burned the city hall in reno  does anybody know that  do you know that  that's not a pleasant sight  how did you allow that to happen  i would've thought you people would've gotten out there  like  ""you're not going to burn our city hall "" and during the violent demonstrations in las vegas a 29- year-old police officer  you know about this  was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job  a vicious criminal left  he was a left person  a left  he was a real left  all right  and the  the young officer as you know  he's a young  brilliant  young guy and he's totally paralyzed  unlike biden  while i'm president of the united states  i will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement  and on november 3rd  you will save america  you're talking about saving america  we cannot let this happen to our country  because i don't know if you can ever come back from what will happen  including our supreme court  we're joined tonight by our terrific republican congressional nominee  who has my complete and total endorsement  jim  where you jim  jim marchant  jim marchant  where are you  a lot of people out there  jim  it's not easy  are you doing well  i just looked at a very solid poll  jim marchant is a great guy and hopefully he's going to win and you're going to carry them over and you need it  you need it  thank you  jim  and also to a man that should have been governor  he should have been governor  what happened  i don't know what happened  nevada attorney

speech  please come over  okay  i'll do one more  ronna  ronna mcdaniel  i'll do one more  ronna  one more "" i do the speech  two days later  i get a call  ""one more  sir  we need one more "" but we ended up winning michigan  first time in decades  ronna mcdaniel  ronna  she was great  and i said when i won  i said  ""well  who are we going to put at the rnc "" that's republican national committee  who we're going to put  and i said  "" how about that woman that ran 窶ｦ"" she was so tough  i said  ""how about the woman that ran michigan that we won  first time in so many years "" so thank you  ronna  great job you're doing  we appreciate it  and another man is doing a fantastic job  who's been a friend of mine for a long time  your gop chair  michael mcdonald  michael  great job  michael  thank you  michael  thank you  mike  how are we doing  michael  are we leading  i hope  okay  i hear we're doing well  be careful of the ballots  that's the only way we're going to lose  can't have this happen to our country  and also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like trump a lot  the nevada trucking association  where are they  nevada trucking  nevada trucking  thank you  thank you  thank you  fellas  thank you very much  great job  we appreciate it very much  those roads are going to get very nice  they're already starting  tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the west battling devastating wildfires  i'm going there the day after tomorrow  i'm staying in your state tonight  but i'm going to be going to california  spoke to the folks in oregon  washington  they never had anything like this  but it is about forest management  please remember the words  very simple  forest management  please remember  it's about forest management and other things but forest management  my administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200 000 people that are working on it and 28 000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there  they are fighting and it's dangerous  it's dangerous  it's rapidly spreading  hundreds of thousands of acres  it's not been anything quite like this one  we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the past 47 years  think of it  he's been there 47 years  and he always says  ""well  why didn't you do this  why did 窶ｦ"" the guy just really in all fairness  i've been here three and a half years  so it's not like they haven't been here  he was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good  he treated obama good  i was going to say something else  but they would have scolded me  that's exactly what i was going to say  but i didn't  it's better than you say it  do you want to shout it out  go ahead  shout  that's what i said  that's what i was 窶ｦ thank you very 窶ｦ this can only happen in nevada  and we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family  nobody even knows this  we virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax  also known as the death tax  does anyone have a small farm  medium-sized farm or business  anybody  if you want to leave it to your children  you don't have to pay tax now because of trump  i always say it and i mean it  if you like your children  it's great  if you don't like your children  it doesn't mean a damn thing  don't leave it to them  i ended the administrations 窶ｦ and if you look at that last administration  what they were doing on american energy  what they were doing  and now we are the world's number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent  how about your gas prices  that's not too bad  right  you didn't think you'd ever see those prices  those under two dollar prices  did you  thank you president trump  i appreciate it  sir  biden has pledged to abolish the production of american oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas  and he wants to ban fracking  right  so he's in these debates with the other people and they're just eating him alive  he did his best debate against crazy bernie and i got to ask  why did he get better  all of a sudden  what happened  why  do you have any idea why  i think i know  why did he get better all of a sudden  but he did his last event  but he was so bad  and he raised his hand  no fracking  ""there will be no fracking under my administration "" he said  and you know why i add the word  he said  because they will take what i said and they will put it as a commercial  there will be no fracking under my administration  they'll have me saying that  that's how dishonest these people are  so i always have to add something because 窶ｦ but even then sometimes they'll cut it off at the end  but he said  there'll be no fracking under my administration  now  all of a sudden he goes to pennsylvania and his polls aren't looking very good because they do big fracking  and he goes to texas and he goes to oklahoma and he goes to north dakota and he goes to all these places  it's not looking so good  all of a sudden he says  ""i have nothing against fracking  what are you talking about "" but always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen  and he has to  because he signed 窶ｦ he has a manifesto  i call it the manifesto with bernie and aoc plus three  all these crazy people  and it's a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything bernie sanders ever said  i thought he'd take what bernie did and move them somewhat to the right  no  he took what bernie said and they moved way further left  it's the craziest thing i've ever seen  but follow the original statements because that's what's going to happen  and they cannot 窶ｦ you know solar  i like solar  but solar is very expensive and it doesn't have the power to fire up our massive plants  we have big plants  including in this great state and you can't fire them up with this stuff  you can't fire it  we need the strength because we're competing against a lot of nations and they don't go through what we do  they don't care about the air and they should  and they should  which is another problem  i took you out of that crazy paris climate accord  because it was totally disaster  no  it was a way of hurting the united states  i tell you  we would have had a close 20  25% of our factories in order to even 窶ｦ it was so crazy  so expensive but i took you out  i was surprised people  most people  they appreciate what i did  because you think it was easy doing that  it was actually  i thought it would be devastating  i got one day of bad press  after that  everybody forgot about it  it wasn't that bad  but i did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working  we want to have our great plants fired up  they said manufacturing jobs are dead  right  sleepy joe said  ""i'm going to bring back manufacturing "" really  well  obama said  you'd need a miracle to bring back manufacturing  i brought back 650 000 jobs  he said you'd need a miracle  and now sleepy joe is saying that  no  no  no  i've got to bring back 窶ｦ he's not going to bring back anything  i made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the united states government to buy american and to hire american  now i did this long time ago  and then i see a sign in front of joe right here  right here  it said  buy american  oh great  joe  thanks  joe  where have you been for 47 years  because for 47 years  joe biden did the opposite  he crushed the dreams of american workers and enriched foreign countries  that's how china happened  hey  look what i've done  i've taken billions  tens of billions of dollars out of china  nobody else did it before me  i mean  no other president  in all fairness  in all fairness to obama and biden  i call him  obiden because it's easier  obiden  in all fairness to obiden  i mean  they didn't do any of that  but now i see buy american  hey  he also copied on the pandemic  did you see he copied everything i was doing  except one thing  he wouldn't have closed the country to china so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that  but two months  two and a half months later  he admitted that i was right  thank you very much  joe  i appreciate it  and yesterday he made  i think he made a mistake  well  what do you think  the usmca  what's better that or nafta  well  no  the usmca is better  was that jake tapper  i like jake tapper  was that 窶ｦ i don't think he was doing 窶ｦ i don't think he likes me too much  but that's okay  they said what's better  they said  what's better  he goes  ""usmca  well  that's the deal that trump made  oh  it is  oh "" that's a great deal we made  we took the horrible nafta deal  we got rid of the nafta  we got rid of tpp  we got rid of that terrible  terrible south korea deal  which hillary clinton said  will produce 250 000 jobs  she said  this will produce 200 窶ｦ she made it  hillary  crooked hillary  she made it  no wait  she said it's going to produce 250 000 jobs  and she was 100% right  it produced 250 000 jobs for south korea  not for us  it produced 250 000 jobs for south korea  not for us  south korea did very well with that deal  but i changed that deal a lot  that's now a good deal  earlier this year  i kept my promise to american workers  when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new usmca mexico-canada agreement into law  you're not going to see companies leaving for mexico very much anymore  they're not going to be leaving your community  going to mexico  making a product  selling the product back in  not being taxed at the border  doesn't work that way anymore  it's probably the biggest reason i ran for president if you want to know that窶ｦ and these stupid  endless wars  i saved the uni-窶ｦ but that's one of the reasons washington doesn't like me  they love those endless wars  you got to ask them  ""why "" do you ever watch where they're very critical of me  i mean  ""we don't like him on foreign policy "" really  look what i've done  look what i've done  israel窶ｦ we're signing deals all over the place  these guys that are lecturing all the time  they don't have a clue  they're clueless  they were clueless  that's why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand  that's all you got  blood in the sand  i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from last administration's job-killing trans-pacific partnership  i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of american jobs  they don't like me too much  joe biden's agenda is  ""made in china""  my agenda is  ""made in the usa""  that's the way  for the last four years  i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic窶ｦ i love a hispanic community  oh  there was a poll today  did you see it  did you see

just窶ｦ did you see it  trump is leading biden with the hispanic community  trump is leading biden  well  hispanics like tough people  they like people that are going to produce jobs  they like窶ｦ and by the way  the hispanics understand the border better than anybody else  they're better than anybody else  no  but we're being窶ｦ you know  it's unusual that a republican would be leading a democrat  not窶ｦ it's habit  you know what the problem is  it's habit  but the hispanics get it  and we're leading with the hispanic community  and that's because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country  you had the best home ownership  every statistic was the best  and now we're doing it again  except we're doing it very rapidly  remember 8 4%  we could have been at 44%  if stupid people ran it  8 4%  i'm fighting for school choice  safe neighborhoods  low taxes and regulations on hispanic-owned  small businesses  we're fighting  you know  the hispanic-owned  small businesses  they're great business people  i know it from being in business  they were very tough  they were great business people and they get it  they get it like very few people get it  i'm also standing up for religious liberty  joe biden would be窶ｦ so joe biden would be a disaster for all communities  not just the hispanic communities  pledged to wage attacks on catholic organizations  like the little sisters of the poor that we're helping  and we're winning with them  we're helping them  they got hit so hard by oh biden  they got hit so hard  i remember them in the supreme court  the little sisters of the poor  they get hit by biden  and then he says  ""how wonderful "" he's such a wonderful person  he supports taxpayer-funded  extreme  late-term abortion  and i mean  ninth month  ninth month  ninth month  and he'd allow violent mobs to burn down your business  and he would hand your country over to the socialists  but i believe it's worse than socialists  i do  i think it's a step worse than socialist  and it starts with a c  that is why we're going to win a record share of the hispanic vote in november  so important  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  it's so important  we're bringing it back very fast  i think next year is窶ｦ next year  i believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year  unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple

incredible border agents  they're incredible people  more than half of whom happen to be hispanic-americans  did you know that  i know all of them  ""jose  how you doing "" ""juan  how you doing "" every sixth time  i'd say  ""hello  jim  how are you "" these extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration  gratitude and respect  not joe biden's contempt  he's got contempt for these people that are so great and brave  that's a tough job  my administration's achieved the most secure border in american history  we ended the catch and release disaster  remember you'd catch somebody  ""what's your name "" ""i don't know "" ""what's your address "" ""i don't know "" ""okay  go into our country  that's okay "" you couldn't arrest anybody  we ended it  stopped asylum fraud and we've deported over 20 000 gang members  including ms13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens  now think about it  think of that number  think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal  illegal aliens  some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out  we're stopping human trafficking  protecting the victims  most of whom are women  most of whom are women  human trafficking because of the internet that's a tremendously big and horrible business  these are the worst human beings of all  but most of the victims are women  children to a much lesser extent  but women and human traffickers  and you know what made it that way is the internet  who would think  it almost sounds like an ancient crime  it's not  it's very modern because of the internet because of the computer  and it's a horrible thing and we've stopped so much of it  we have an incredible group of people that go after these animals  and we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week  and the wall will very soon be finished  it'll be finished  we've invested  2 5 trillion in the us military  we've rebuilt our depleted窶ｦ it was a depleted military  now we have the newest  we have the best we've ever had and launched the first new branch of the united states armed forces in nearly 75 years  the us space force  and we did things that people said couldn't be done  after 52 years  we passed va choice in va accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their va care  they think it's doing great  the fact is i did more in 47 months as president than joe biden did in 47 years  it's true  it's true  i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  we eliminated the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of american troops  qasem soleimani  he's dead  he's gone  biden voted for the iraq war  he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed killing soleimani  he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development  oh  really  tell me about it  tell me about it  not too positive  joe biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years  in fact  the secretary of state  secretary of defense said about him  ""he's never called it right  he never called it right "" if we had listened to joe  hundreds of thousands more americans would right now have died  when the virus arrived  we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  you know that  especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields  we're delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world  and you don't hear that from the fake news  europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher  and these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff  right  this is not done by my secretary  24% higher than the united states and despite their punitive lockdowns  they're once again seeing a spike  they're seeing a big spike in cases over there  they did the heavy lockdowns  just like you're doing right here  and they're seeing a spike  and there's no reason for that  the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation  think of that  and by far  the fastest recovery  and if they wrote about it properly  it would be a proper thing  a proper thing to do  through our historic relief programs  we've saved more than half a trillion nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet  so many people going out  we've saved 42 000 nevada businesses  think of that  biden would terminate this comeback  he wants to end it  he would terminate this comeback  he would put your families in danger  he will totally destroy social security  and in my opinion  if you look at what he's going to do to medicare  they will destroy social security  they will  you called it  you know what you're talking about  exactly  right  he's going to massively raise your taxes  reimpose crippling federal regulations  destroy your social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions  he's going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks  your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before  he'll obliterate your second amendment  he'll give you窶ｦ and he would  he would give free窶ｦ he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt medicare  he wants to give窶ｦ you saw him raise his hand  remember the debate where they're all standing there and he looked around  ""who's going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens "" and everyone's raising hands  he's going  ""oh窶ｦ"" now take a look  i'm not kidding  it's sad  it's pathetic  he would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%  opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations  you understand that  he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal  illegal aliens  he loves sanctuary cities  meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities  biden  pledges to oppose school choice  and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are ""gone""  they're gone  in the second term  and we've already started it very heavily  i will provide school choice to every parent in america  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs and a limitless future for all americans  instead of letting washington change us  despite all that we've been through and we've been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they're falling one after another  but you do notice that i hope  one after another  oh  i see the phones have been wiped out  i wonder what that's all about  but that's a criminal thing you did  we are changing washington  we are changing washington  never forget that they're coming after me because i am fighting for you  and it's true  over the next four years to conclude  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world  and we will end our reliance on china once and for all  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  we will rapidly return to full employment  soaring economies and a record prosperity  even greater than last year  we will

understand when you see those commercials  it means your drug prices are coming down  we will strongly protect medicaid and social security  which they will give up  and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools  and we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  and we

19,10,Oct,2019,datasets/Minneapolis,"thank you very much  thank you  minnesota  this is a great state  we are going to win this state in a very short period of time  thank you  this feels like the day before the election  so we have 20 000-plus people inside  we just set a new record  and we have 25 000 people that we still love  outside  and close to 100 000 people wanted to come tonight  thank you all  this is great  this is really great  thank you  i want to thank our great vice president  mike pence  and karen pence  for being here tonight  it is great to be back in the twin cities with the freedom-loving american patriots who make our country run  you know that  you know it  for the next 13 months  think of that  it seems like yesterday  for the next 13 months  we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul  and we are going to win the great state of minnesota in 2020  america now has the number one economy anywhere in the world  and it's not even close  you know i'm dealing with china right now  they're in washington  we're going to see if we make a deal  but they want to make it  we're going to determine whether or not we want to make it  but they've been very nice  and today i got a call from one of the top representatives  he said  ""congratulations  mr  president  on having a truly great  great economy "" that's pretty nice  we picked up  since the election  trillions of dollars in value  and china has lost trillions of dollars in value  i will say this  if our opponent had won that election  you know what would have happened  right now china would become the 窶ｦ it would be the number one economy anywhere in the world  and right now i can tell you they're not even close  our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting  for the first time in a long time  we are putting america first   cops love trump  trump loves cops  our bold pursuit of this pro-american agenda has enraged  and you know what's happened  it's enraged the failed ruling class in washington  not easy to get them out  but we're doing it slowly  but surely  these corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding america dry  and they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country  and that's what they were doing  and that's what they continue to try and do  that is why  from day one  the wretched washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election  the election of 2016  they're trying  they're not getting very far  they want to erase your vote like it never existed  they want to erase your voice  and they want to erase your future  but they will fail  because in america  the people rule again  do you remember that  just 19 minutes after i raised my hand and took the oath of office  the washington post  a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth  published a story  and in this case  they might've gotten it pretty correct  they said  ""the campaign to impeach president trump has begun "" that was the headline  little did we know they weren't playing games  think of that  that was 19 minutes after the oath of office  months earlier  peter strzok  remember  he and his lover  lisa page  what a group  ""she's going to win 10 million to one  she's going to win  i'm telling you  peter  i'm telling you  peter  she's going to win  peter  oh  i love you so much "" ""i love you  peter "" ""i love you too  lisa  lisa  i love you  lisa  lisa  oh god  i love you  lisa  and if she doesn't win  lisa  we've got an insurance policy  lisa  we'll get that son of a bitch out  we got an insurance policy "" and we're living through the insurance policy  that's what it is  the phony russia hoax  "" lisa  i love you "" now the do-nothing democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate  13 months  they got to move fast  because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it  despite the phony polls that you see all the time  their phony polls  you know  polls are no different  remember i always used to talk about polls  i know polls very well  polls are no different than crooked writers  they're crooked polls  they're crooked polls  no different  boy  that's a lot of media  look back there  that's a lot of media  they are so dishonest  and frankly  they are so bad for our country  they are so bad  and they could be so good for our country  they could be so good  and maybe they'll change  and maybe they won't  i've been waiting for a long time  after i won the last election  i said  ""finally it's okay  finally i'll get some great press "" they got worse  they got worse  i said  ""finally  we're going to get 窶ｦ"" i said to the first lady  ""darling  we're going to finally get respect  we're going to finally get media and press coverage  it's going to be great  look at what we've done "" and i'm telling you  they did  they got worse  they know they cannot win  you understand  well  if you didn't understand  honestly  there's no way anybody could win  because you'd believe them  if you believe them  there's no way anybody could 窶ｦ because it's like 94% 窶ｦ i can do the greatest things in history  and they'll make them bad to very bad  and if i do a neutral  something neutral  it worked out okay  not great  it's like  ""give him the electric chair  that was terrible "" right  no  this is the worst  these people and the democrats  they're partners  it's a partnership  how about on the newscast  like the word ""manufactured "" it's manu窶ｦ and every newscast  ""tonight  in a manufactured deal along the border 窶ｦ"" the word's never been used 窶ｦ all of a sudden every newscast is using it  it's a talking point given to these fakers by the democrats  so they know they can't win the 2020 election  so they're pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt  i've been going through it now for more time than i've been in office  because  like strzok with his insurance deal  this was before  remember this  this was before  that statement was made months before i took office  that statement was made months before the election took place  they said  ""just in case  we're going to have an insurance policy "" that only means one thing  ""we're going to get him out "" so they're telling us  we can't let that ever happen again to another president  and rush limbaugh  sean hannity  a lot of people  the great mark levin  we have a lot of great people  lou dobbs  great people  you know what they said  every one of them  plus many others  ""there's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it "" it's true  maybe i'm a little different up here  i don't know  but i enjoy it  to me  i'm energized because we're draining the swamp  the democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country  these are bad people  my phone call  as an example  with the president of ukraine  was perfect  everybody that looked at it  and the only reason i released it was that the democrats put out a phony narrative  so i had no choice  and i don't want to do that as president  every time a president from a country calls me  or i call them  we have to release the text  how can you do business that way  who's going to want to speak to your president  so the president of ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference  on other subjects  that he was under absolutely no pressure  he doesn't even know what they're talking about  and he used the word  there was no ""blackmail"" during this call  he used that term  so in theory  that should be the end of it  think of it  a president of the united states who's made our economy  with a lot of help from all of you  frankly  but from mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us  we made this the strongest economy in our history  we've rebuilt our military  we're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do  what we've done is incredible  and by the way  we're protecting your second amendment  if you don't have me  your second amendment is gone  so we have the greatest economy  the greatest military  we've rebuilt our military   2  5 trillion  because when i took it over  it was a mess  and what do they want to do  ""let's impeach our president "" right  i don't think so  i don't think so  i think we're going to have a turnout the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country  so we were really forced  just to put it away  we were forced  i said  ""just do it "" got the approval from ukraine  i have to ask  i said  ""hey  do you guys mind "" they said  ""that's a strange request "" i said  ""don't worry about it  do you mind "" and they said  ""please  go ahead  nothing was said wrong on that call "" so we released the transcript of the call  which was so good that that crooked adam schiff  this guy is crooked  he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- a fake conversation that never happened  and he delivered it to the united states congress and the american people  it was a total fraud  and then nancy pelosi said  ""oh  i think the president said that "" these people are sick  i'm telling you  they're sick  and you know what  had they waited one day longer  they would have had the transcript of the actual call  word for word  it would've been perfect  instead  they released it  they went early  they said all these horrible things  you know why  because they never thought in a million years that i was going to release a transcript of the call  so nancy pelosi  upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call  or somebody gave her very bad advice  but also hearing it from shifty shift nancy pelosi said  a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the ukrainian president  ""we've got to impeach him  we've got to impeach him "" right  and then she saw the call and she said to her people  ""what the hell  nobody ever told me this was the call "" but she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands  the do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally  and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual  beautiful  accurate phone call with a foreign leader  i don't think so  as our brilliant white house counsel wrote to the democrats yesterday  he said  ""their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions  to our system of free elections  and to the american people "" that's what it is  to the american people  it's so terrible  democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy  that's what's happening  we will never let it happen  we will defeat them  i mean  look at their debates  these people are crazy  they want to spend  99 trillion to redo buildings all over the united states  i said  ""what about china  what about russia  what about india  what about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out "" it's all right  let him give you the answer  man  did the cops act fast  he's already gone  that's unbelievable  that's the fastest 窶ｦ you know i have 窶ｦ look  i love law enforcement  i love the cops  i love the police  all of it  minneapolis  minneapolis  you've got a rotten man  you've got to change your mayor  you've got a bad mayor  you've got a bad mayor  but you know what  the police 窶ｦ i've done this a lot and every once in a while we'll have very little disturbance  it's really 窶ｦ actually  is there any place where we can have more fun than at a trump rally  and we've set every record at every place  virtually  that we've gone  and one of the big musicians said  ""and trump does it without a guitar "" can you believe it  without a guitar  but this guy 窶ｦ so i've had it a lot where 窶ｦ but sometimes it'll take the police like 30 seconds  50 seconds  it's like roger penske when you watch him  who's getting the presidential medal of freedom  by the way  pretty soon  he won 18 indy 500s  18  roger penske  but it's like the way they change those tires  takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing  i say  ""how the hell do they do it "" that's the way these cops just reacted  that was a record  i think it was a 窶ｦ i've had good service  but i've never had anything like that  i look up  the guy is already gone  ah  we love you with the red shirts  so now the democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy joe  sleepy joe biden  and you know what  i'd love to run against him  to be honest  anybody like that  if you can't beat him in a debate  you've got a big problem folks  you can't beat him in a debate  you can't be president  because what are you going to do against president xi and kim jong un  you can't beat sleepy joe  but now we're going to meet with kim jong un  i don't think so  but he's totally owned and totally controlled by the washington swamp for many years  two months after president obama put joe in charge of ukraine policy  they put joe biden in charge of ukraine policy  listen to this  and the press will not write it  they say  ""in totally unsubstantiated charges 窶ｦ"" every time they talk about him  president trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune  now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge  really  it's not an unsubstantiated  it's fact  joe's son hunter got thrown out of the navy and then he became a genius on wall street in about two days  by the way  whatever happened to hunter  where the hell is he  where's hunter  hey fellows  i have an idea for a new t-shirt  i love the cops  but let's do another t-shirt  where's hunter  where is he  here's hunter  being examined by sleepy eyes chuck todd or some of these people  hunter  it's so great that you're here  sir  hunter  i know they're giving you approximately  168 000 a month  i hear they paid you a big check of  3 million  i just want to speak on behalf of nbc who's absolutely one of the worst  i just want to tell you 窶ｦ hunter  hunter i just want to tell you i couldn't be happier for you and your family and i know you don't know anything about energy and i know it's an energy company  but i think they made a great deal  hunter  and then they fly to china  and i'm dealing with people right now  they're tough as hell  those chinese negotiators  and hunter  who's not too smart  hunter  he goes in  he has a meeting  he walks out in his fund with 1 5 billion  with a b  one point five billion dollars  these aren't the same chinese negotiators that i'm dealing with  i can tell you  these are not the same ones  but we are doing very well in that negotiation  now  think of it  where's hunter  where is hunter  i want to see hunter  hunter  you know nothing about energy  you know nothing about china  you know nothing about anything  frankly  hunter  you're a loser  why did you get one point five billion dollars  hunter  and your father was never considered smart  he was never considered a good senator  he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama's ass  true  thank you  thank you  it's true  it's true  and they're always saying the same thing  yeah  he got a billion five  we admit it  they admit it  it's nothing  but oh  it's not that same thing  president trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about hunter biden and his father  it's not unsubstantiated  you crooked son of a guns  it's 100% true  100%  even the smart guys on wall street  and i know all of them  they are smart  they've never seen anything like that one before  i've called them  does that ever happen  never happens  guy walks in  no experience  no nothing  walks out with a billion five  gee  flies in on air force two with his father  the vice president  don't forget  that's when he was vice president  so china gives his son 1 5 billion  how would you like to have joe biden take over negotiations right now with china  i don't think so  i don't think so  meanwhile  biden allowed china to rip off america for eight years as vice president  and barack obama let him just rob us blind  and we're not doing that anymore  those days are over  the bidens got rich and that is substantiated  while america got robbed  that's what happened  sleepy joe and his friends out america  they didn't have tough negotiations  i look at these trade deals and i say  ""who the hell could have done this "" if you didn't 窶ｦ if you had no business instinct  no business ability  if you had nothing  if you're dumb as hell  you wouldn't make these deals  they're so bad  i say  ""who made these deals  who made these deals "" but we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good  wait until you see what happens  now that i'm your president  you see it  america is winning again and we're respected again as a nation  a brand new report just came out as i'm walking on the stage  hard to believe  actually  it turns out that joe biden was vice president  he worked with the so called whistle blower  this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt  sabotage  and i'm sure they're going to say it's totally unsubstantiated  but one of them wrote this story  congratulations  by the way  that's very nice  that's really good  that's the way you should do it  good  good  good  in the twisted worldview of democrats and the media  it's okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries  flood our communities with drugs and crime  and enrich themselves at america's expense  their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged washington game  and it is far more rigged  when i ran  i thought it was rigged  but this is crazy what's happening  but if you refuse to bow or bend to the washington swamp  which i could do very easily  i'd be much more popular  folks  it would be so much easier  but they smear you  they spy on you  and they target your friends  your family  your staff for harassment  for abuse  for destruction  i came down to washington with incredible people  we won a great political campaign  they were bright eyed and bushy tailed  that's a nice phrase  they came down  they were happy  they wanted to turn the country around  they wanted to do great things  all of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by robert mueller  how good was he as a witness  not too good and by people that were  i call them the 13 angry democrats  that turned into 18 angry democrats  it was disgraceful  so people that were going down  ""sir  what is this "" i look  ""oh wow  that's a subpoena "" what the hell is this  they took people 窶ｦ i really mean this  they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor  we had just won the greatest campaign in the history of american politics  it's true  it's true  and they destroyed their lives  they destroyed their lives  they went home  i could name many people  one in particular  who came down  an incredible young woman  she was going to help people  she wanted to help people  she had causes that were so good  she wanted to help people  and she ended up going home  dark  dark  her life became hell  they ruined people  they destroyed people  good people  people that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made  than they made  they destroyed great people  they're vicious  horrible  and the media was behind every single step  they destroyed so many lives  they destroyed so many lives  and they're continuing to do it  and it's a disgrace  when all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds  these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption  there's nothing like the dirty political establishment  and i have to tell you  this is  friend of mine  very smart  brilliant guy  was with me about two weeks ago  we just got rid of the russia hoax and then a week later the ukraine hoax starts  i had a week of like  ""i can think about everything perfect  it's so beautiful "" and he said  ""president "" i said  ""call me donald  you've called me donald for 35 years "" ""i will  thank you donald "" i've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk  honestly  i'm the president that they can't talk to me anymore  it's like they're afraid  they respect the office  it's true  they say  ""president "" i say  ""do me a favor  richard  you've called me donald for 35 years  call me donald  please  i want somebody to call me donald "" true  he said to me  i just told him call me 窶ｦ he said  ""president  i can't do it "" he said  so he says  ""president  you've been here now for  think of it  almost three years  can you believe we're here three years "" we  we  it's we  and we have to promise them no more than 16 years  okay  no more  no more  16 more years  i'm only kidding  now they'll go back  see  he wants to run for more  but he said  ""president  could i ask you a question  it's so important to me "" he's a great businessman  very successful  he said  ""you deal with all of these nations  these great  powerful 窶ｦ who is the worst to deal with  is it china  is it north korea  is india  is it russia  please tell me  mr  pres  who is the toughest nation to deal with "" i said  ""you're not going to believe this  it's the usa is the toughest nation to deal with "" the usa  it's true  because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people  there is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate  own and control  they're trying to stop me because they know that i don't answer to them  i answer to you  it's true  i never say this  i don't think i've ever said it in a speech  but they'll find out if i did  they'll give me pinocchios  he said it before  but i don't know if i ever said this before  but i make  as president  about  450 000  i give it away  i don't care  i don't want it  i never hear anything  can you imagine if i didn't  i give it away to 窶ｦ you can only give it  you can't keep it  you can't actually make a gift  you can give it to your different agencies  so i can give it to health  i can give it to transportation  i can give it to military  but i give it away all the time  now  and if i ever did 窶ｦ but it's 450  if somebody stays from  let's say  a middle east country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying  and i never heard of the guy and i don't want to hear about him  they say  ""trump is getting rich off our nation "" i lose billions being president  i don't care  it's nice to be rich  i guess  but i lose billions  if somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees  i never heard of the people  i never know who they are  they say  ""emoluments "" nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before  emoluments  it's the craziest thing i've ever seen  i tell you  it's cost me billions of dollars to be president  it really has  and at some point i'll probably to prove that  and i look forward to doing it  it's very easy  it's very easy  and there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created  so in desperate attempt to attack our movement  nancy and chuck  two beauties  have given control of the democrat party entirely over to the radical left  including minnesota's own representative ilhan omar  i know you people  i know you people  i know the people of minnesota  and i want to tell you  and i also  at the same time  it's both a question and a statement  how'd the hell did that ever happen  how did it happen  how did it happen  congresswoman omar is an america hating socialist  she minimized the september 11th attack on our homeland  where far more than 3 000 people died  saying  ""some people did something big deal  some people did something "" she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits right here in minnesota  omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda  you remember that tape  speak of al-qaeda  but when we say something about the united states  you just don't say america with any intensity  remember that  representative omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds  whether you like it or not  she's said the us support for israel is all about the benjamins  she said that pro-israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country  omar wrote that israel has hypnotized the world  may allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of israel and the united states  how do you have such a person representing you in minnesota  i'm very angry at you people right now  she is a disgrace to our country  and she is one of the big reasons that i'm going to win  and the republican party is going to win minnesota in 13 months  thank you very much  so we're honored to have with us today a special guest  a man that really is a terrific talented writer  he knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of omar  mr  scott johnson of power line  he wrote some stuff  i can't believe it  where's scott  where's scott  thank you  scott  thank you  scott  what a job  man  do you have her figured out  the only problem is  scott  it's incredible talent  much more talented than most of these people that you heard about  the problem is they never pick it up  they don't want to pick it up  but we pick it up  scott  and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting  thank you  thank you very much  and scott reported everything about omar is a fraud  including her name  scott reports his sources told him that  quote  omar's legal husband was omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes  you mean like coming into the united states  maybe  and as scott says  ""we have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like omar's in congress  and nothing gets done about it "" i hope that some of you people are looking  because what aoc has gotten away with campaign financing and what 窶ｦ i call it aoc plus three  that's what it is  and omar is one of the three  what aoc has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse  and nothing happens to them  but it happens to you  and it's not fair  the fact is  we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in america  the only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd  2020  with your help  we will win back the house  we will keep the senate and we will win the white house  and we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much  one of your tremendous talented  tough  congressman tom emmer  tom  also a man  you don't want to fight him  and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough  he just won  not that recently but pretty recently  and i was out here campaigning for him and working hard  and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him  congressman pete stauber  and a man who gets in the trenches  and he just doesn't care  he wants to win for the people  he loves you  he loves this state  he loves this country  jim hagedorn  thank you  and a great friend of mine with his incredible family  he's a friend  he's smart  i guess you'd say he's brilliant  his education is incredible  his military career has been incredible  then he ran for office  and now he's a united states senator from the great state of arkansas  senator tom cotton  great guy  and minnesota senate majority leader  paul gazelka  paul  thank you paul  minnesota gop chairwoman  jennifer carnahan  she's been incredible  i said  ""jennifer  are we going to win in 13 months "" she said  ""honestly sir  i've never seen anything like this  it's going to be easy  don't ever say窶ｦ just assume we're two points behind  okay "" two points behind  you never ever窶ｦ please  always just assume you're a little behind  but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked  ad plenty of other states too  we had a rally three weeks ago in new mexico  and new mexico's a hard state for republicans  hasn't been won in a long time also  and we had receptivity that was unbelievable  the audience was 40% hispanic  where we're doing great  and you know  hispanic  they understand borders better than anybody  better than we do  they understand safety  they understand their job  they don't want people taking it away  they don't want crime  they understand it better  that's why we're doing so well  but we're in new mexico  and i'm telling you  that was electric  but honestly  all evenings are electric  we haven't had any bad ones  we haven't  they're all electric  a woman who headed up the great state of michigan for me  a state that hadn't been won in a long time by a republican for whatever reason  but it hadn't been won  i guess we didn't have the right candidates  right  but a woman who would call me constantly  i'd say  ""i don't want to talk to her  she's giving me a headache "" ""sir  if you make one more trip  you're going to win michigan "" i say  ""all right "" i make the trip  i go back home  i get a call the next morning  ""sir  we need one more "" this went over and over and over  and we ended up winning the state of michigan  and i said  ""who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to michigan and speak just one more time every week  one more time  sir "" and her name is ronna mcdaniel  she's fantastic  and she's the head of the rnc  she's great  and our campaign manager  a man who's really been窶ｦ they used to say that crooked hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign  after she lost  they said  ""i guess it wasn't sophisticated "" we had a sophisticated campaign  nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy  brad parscale  remember when they used to say it  you know  i never got credit  my father used to teach me  if you can do it for less and win  that's good  he wasn't talking politics  the last thing窶ｦ he's looking down  he's definitely looking down  not looking up  he was great  he was tough  but he was great  but my father would say  ""if you could do it for less and win  that's a good thing  not a bad thing  if you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street  and if it's a nicer building and you can rent for less  you're really窶ｦ that's like a good thing "" so in the campaign  we spent much less money than crooked hillary clinton  much  and we won  and we won  we won 306 to 223  that's a pretty big窶ｦ remember  remember they said electoral college  by the way  when you run  if you're running  the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash  and the total vote  you don't go certain places  you focus  electoral college  we have to explain to them  it's different  so we won 306  and do you remember they sued to say one's the 100 yard dash  you practice  one's the mile  you practice  it's a different race  winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion  the electoral college  i had to go to 22 different states  for the total vote  i'd go to four states maximum  right  much easier  it's much easier  i'm all for it  but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go  i love maine  i went to maine four or five times  i needed one point  maine gave me one point  and what happened  what happened  i went there numerous times  everyone said  ""why "" because i was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that trump cannot get to 270  he cannot get窶ｦ they had me maximum  if everything worked  right  at 269  so i kept going to maine  and you know what  we won that one point in maine  we won it  it's true  but i kept going  they say  ""why "" i said  ""well  first of all  it is really a beautiful place "" but we won the point  but they said  ""he can not get to 270 "" and i heard this for months and months  i had such a headache  almost as bad as listening to mike's damn commercials about those pillows  maybe i need one of those pillows to cure my headache  does it cure headaches  i think so  but here's the thing  here's the thing  so they said  ""he cannot get to 270 "" in other words  you can't win  you don't get to 270  it's over  you can't win  right  he cannot do it  there's no way of doing it  and they were right  i got to 306  they were right  but i didn't get to 306  you got to 306  we won incredible states  we won incredible states  we won wisconsin  we won michigan  we won pennsylvania  we won north carolina  we won south carolina  we won florida  what a run  do you remember the evening that we won  i think窶ｦ look  forgetting me  i think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard  i was the messenger  but we all worked hard  that was our victory  not my victory  but that was one of the greatest nights in

to go  but it needs a little窶ｦ that's why we need the four more additionally years  it's got to grab on and catch  so they can't destroy it  so they can't destroy it  but i think it'll go down  and i hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country  because it's never happened  anything like that before  and these guys don't even question it  they just sit back and say  ""i guess he's right about that "" i'll never forget the night before  i was at a tremendous arena  the place was going crazy  it was like this  going crazy  and two reporters that hate my guts  they looked at themselves  they looked at each other  famous shot  they're looking like this and they're saying  ""what the hell is going on "" they knew  they knew  and i didn't need beyonce and jay z  and i didn't need little bruce springsteen and all of these people  they'd get all these people  they'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd  they'd come in  they'd sing  they got bruce springsteen  okay  he'd do about two songs and leave  what happens is  they leave  and then everyone leaves with them  and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd  it's the craziest thing i've ever seen  and then they complain  sometimes i'll use terrible word like hell  the other day i used the word hell  i got hell from窶ｦ they said  ""he used terrible language "" i used the word hell  it was so bad  but you've got to hear jay z  the words he was using  he was using the f word all over the place  and then the next day they say i use bad language  the word hell is a terrible word  these people are sick  but that was an amazing evening  i'll never forget that evening  look  outside of your family and your children and things窶ｦ i love you too  darling  it was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television  you add up all those networks  remember the woman crying  oh my god  no  they weren't biased at all  now  another very special man who's with us today  but he'll never be a man to me  he'll always be my boy  you know what i mean  right  he's my boy  he's my little six foot six boy  eric trump  and the parents understand that  right  they may be big and strong and older  to a parent  a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl  and i know that's probably politically incorrect  they'll say  ""it was terrible what he said about women  terrible "" but they're our boy and they're our girl  and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get  is that a correct statement  and i'm also proud to endorse your next republican senator from minnesota  a man that i've known  a man that is tough and smart  a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the senate  mr  jason lewis  and jason did a great job in congress  congressman lewis  thank you very much  and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because i'll tell you  it's going to be nasty  it's going to be nasty  they're going to make up stories about you  they're going to say things that's going to want to make your wife say  ""why did i marry this guy "" just say  ""don't worry about it  it's just another phony story "" thank you very much mr  and mrs  lewis  jason  thank you  and jason  they can say that about tom cotton  he's too perfect  this guy  he can't say窶ｦ they can't say it about you  tom  anyway  good luck jason  do well  and i don't know why  but with all of the great people i just introduced  for tonight  maybe this is the most important person  because i turned on a very good show in the morning  fox and friends  they treat us great  i just want fairness  what a great group  ainsley and steve  and by the way  brian has gotten a lot better  right  and how good does jessie waters do  how good  right  just some really great people  and again  tucker's been very good i have to say  he's been good  smart  he's been great  tucker  and the legendary sean hannity  great  number one  number one show  sean's got the number one show  and laura ingraham is knocking them out of the park  laura  and you go over  maria bartiromo  and the great lou dobbs  how good are they  lou dobbs  and many more  and many more  how about greg  greg used to hate me  now  he's good  oh  we can't forget窶ｦ we can't forget judge jeanine  i would be in such trouble if i forgot judge jeanine  no  these are窶ｦ and there are many more  i just窶ｦ look  i'm just rattling some names off  but they're just terrific people  they're terrific people  but a man that i have to really say something very special about窶ｦ 00 slot  because i'm out of there pretty good  and i see a handsome young man named bob kroll  cops for trump  and he's talking about this lousy mayor they've got  now  he didn't quite say that  but i say it  he's talking about this lousy mayor that won't let the cops  the police  the law enforcement窶ｦ my father always used to say  ""son窶ｦ"" and he meant it to  ""never say cops  it's disrespectful  say police officer "" i said  ""okay pop "" but honestly  the truth is with time  i love you guys whether you're cops  police officers  law enforcement  i'll call you whatever you want  it doesn't matter  you are so great  so respected  you don't even know how much our public loves you  you don't know it  you don't know it  you don't know it  but i see this guy  and i don't know if he's done a lot of television before  but he was very effective and very good  and he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally  and yet with president obama and bush and all these people  they were fine  fine  everybody comes  they fall asleep at a rally  but they weren't allowed to do the job for us  and they went wild  so what i want to do窶ｦ go home to mommy  mommy says  ""i saw you on television tonight  i love trump  don't you ever do that again "" ""yes mom  yes mom "" but the job he did before the election  i came right here to minnesota  and i pledged to address this really important issue  and it's the issue of law enforcement  and when i saw this man  this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts  pouring out his heart窶ｦ i don't know him  he knows i've been good to law enforcement  he knows i've been good to  as my father would say  ""the police "" he knows i love the cops  he knows that  and so does everyone else  i mean  it's so many shirts  so many red shirts  and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts  and i want to just tell you  the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound  it's unbound  come up here  bob  come up  say something  thank you fellas  i'll see you later  thank you  thank you very much  thank you  great people  thank you  what a group  i think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on  as you know  for many years  leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers  i promised you that as president  i would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy  and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls  and i've done that  since coming into office  i have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%  and as you know  maybe especially in minnesota  i kept another promise  i issued an executive action  making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state  so speak to your mayor  you should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods  and that's what you have the right to do right now  and believe me  no other president would be doing that  if democrats were ever to seize power  they would open the floodgates to unvetted  uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before  do you think you have it bad now  you would never have seen anything like what they want to do  but in the trump administration  we will always protect american families first  and that has not been done in minnesota  we've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place  we are keeping terrorists  criminals and extremists the hell out of our country  and i want to thank the country of mexico  the president of mexico has been incredible  we have now  27 000 mexican soldiers  they're great  and they're tough  and they are now protecting our border  and those numbers have gone down like this  thank you mr  president  we will not make the mistakes made in european countries  that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country  on our shores  we're not going to allow it to happen  and as you all know  to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us  i instituted a very controversial  very hard to get  travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries  and the other day  one of the fake news reporters in the back said窶ｦ they were talking about the travel ban  and they said  ""well you know  the president has lost in court "" they said  ""where "" ""on the travel ban "" and he's right  i lost  and then i lost at the appellate division  and then i won at the united states supreme court  right  and he knew that  but he said i lost on the窶ｦ and he was right  i lost  and then i lost again  but then i won  and we have the travel ban  but instead of saying  ""he lost  and then he lost at the appellate  and then he won at the united states supreme court "" he said  ""he lost on the travel ban "" these are very dishonest people  do you understand that  very dishonest people  in the republican party  we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values  honor our history  and love our people  democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities  which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities  and we're not letting it happen anymore  republicans believe american cities should be sanctuaries for americans  not for criminal aliens  my administration is taking historic action to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since may  and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built  and this is a serious wall  you've all seen it  it's going up rapidly  and you think that was easy  i had every democrat in congress fighting me  fighting me  fighting me  i had a lot of the rhinos fighting me  they say  ""see  he's not getting it built  he's not getting窶ｦ"" let me tell you  you have every democrat fighting you  we took it from here  and we took it from there  and we took it from all over the place  and we got that thing  that's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen  and that sucker is going up  and it is the finest  it is the strongest  it's largely 30 feet tall  which is the maximum height that they wanted  i went to the border patrol  and i sat down with 15 representatives of the border patrol  and i said  ""what do you want  what's your ideal "" i actually said  ""i want to give you the rolls royce "" and they killed me for that  they said  ""it's not an american made product "" yeah  they happened to be right  no  they're right about that one  they're actually right there  tom  but i said  ""i want to give you the rolls royce of walls  tell me "" and they told me everything  and then we built some alternative walls  we built all different types  we built about seven of them  and then we had climbers come in  the one that worked the best was the one we're building  it also  unfortunately窶ｦ the bad news  it's also the most expensive  but we got it for the right price  we got it for the right price  it's steel  it's hardened concrete  it's deep  it's high  it's a thing of beauty  and it's going to keep bad people out of our country  that's what it's going to do  and the democrats knew this  most of the democrats four years ago  they wanted a wall  now all of a sudden  they don't want a wall  you know why they don't want a wall  because i want it  that's the only reason  and i just thought of it a year ago  i said  ""man  this could've been so much easier "" all i had to do is say  ""we don't want a wall "" and they would've given me all the financing i wanted for the wall  what was i thinking  we're not going to build a wall  and they would have forced me to build it  i would've窶ｦ it's true  under this administration  we are also ending the- 窶ｦ this administration  we are also ending the endless wars  we have to do it  folks  we have to do it  we have totally defeated the isis caliphate  and i did that in rather quick time if you remember  because we have the greatest fighting machine  now  when i came in and was totally depleted  we have great generals  we have great warfighters  and they did it so fast  i flew to iraq  i met with the generals  right  i met with the generals  i said  ""i hear it's going to take a year to two years "" ""sir  we can do it in two weeks "" i said  ""what "" ""they don't let us fight  sir  they don't let us fight  we want to fight  they don't let us fight "" i said  ""i let you fight "" i said  ""how come if they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years  you say you can do it so quickly "" he said  ""sir  we're going to hit them from the front  we're going to hit them from the back  we're going to hit them from the sides  from underground  from overground  we going to hit the hell out of them "" and they did  and we won very quickly  but from now on  we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the united states of america  not to the benefit of other countries  and we will only fight to win  we're only going to fight to win  we don't fight to win  we don't fight to win  the turks have been fighting with the kurds for two centuries  and turkey  as you know  is a nato ally  but i've been rough on them  we've defeated 100% of that isis caliphate  and no longer have any troops in the area  we don't have any troops  the troops have been pulled out  where turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the kurds  get them out  so turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the kurds  we got along with the kurds  and we helped the kurds  and don't forget they're also fighting for their land  you know that  but they're fighting  so we have three choices  you're ready  here are the three choices  we don't have any soldiers there because we've left  we won  we left  take a victory  united states  we left  take a victory  take a victory  bring our troops back home  i told this story yesterday  i have to sign letters  it's the hardest thing i have to do  i sign letters  ""dear mr  and mrs  smith from arkansas  dear mr  and mrs  jones from alabama  dear mr  and mrs  somebody from some great state  i'm sorry to inform you  your son has been killed in combat  i'm so sorry "" and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents  they're grieving  and they get together with other parents  and i don't want to see that it's like the same letter  so we do different letters  it's the hardest thing i have to do  hardest thing it's the hardest thing i have 窶ｦ i was telling tom cotton  it's the hardest thing that i have to do  and i sign those letters  and it just  it breaks your heart  and by the way  there's a time to fight  nobody fights harder than i do  but there's a time  and there's not necessarily a time  but i send these letters out  quite a few  and sometimes i send letters out  it's called blue on green  where we're teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back  and that's the hardest thing for a parent  i have all of them  i know everyone  that's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification  because they learn how their child has died  when the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them  and shoot  we've had a lot of that  a lot of it in afghanistan  more than we've ever had proportionately before  it's a horrible  horrible thing  but i have to sign these letters  and sometimes i go out to a place  dover air force base  it's a very tough experience  mike pence goes  i go  other people go  tom cotton goes  we go out there  and we meet the parents and the families  the wives  the children  the sisters  the brothers  we meet them  and we talked to them  and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin  and these things are just impossible  i don't know how parents can do it  even  and i'll meet them  and we have a particular colonel  that's all he does  so good  so professional  that's what he does  he said  ""i greet the dead  sir  i greet the dead "" and what happens is this big incredible machine flies in  this tremendous cargo plane  and it flies in so powerful  so big  i'll be talking to some of the parents  and they'll act like they're fine  i said  ""how are you doing "" ""we're fine  sir  we're fine  we're really good "" i say  ""that's great "" and i'll tell the colonel  i'll say  ""colonel  i think they're doing great "" ""no sir  they're not going to do great  you'll see "" and i didn't know what he was talking about  this is the first time  then we went outside to the runway  and this incredible machine is flying in  and it lands  and it comes over  and it pulls up  and we have military guards  we have incredible talented musicians that do this  that's what they do  what happens is that door opens up  and the colonel told me  he said  ""sir  when that door opens up  those same people that you think are okay  do things that you'll never see  you will hear sounds like you've never heard "" that's what he does  i saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it  the door was opened  and these beautiful soldiers  five or six on each side  lifting the coffin and walking down the runway  the plank  they call it  off this cargo plane  and i see parents make sounds  that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine  make sounds  scream and cry like you've never seen before  the colonel was telling me that  ""sir  you'll see things that you've never seen before  a mother who was fine 20 minutes ago  you think  breaking the military line and jumping off  and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter  jumping on  on top of the flowers  on top of the american flag "" i've seen this  then i have all these people that want to stay  they want to stay  and i don't want to stay  we were supposed to be in syria for 30 days  we've now been there for 10 years  we were supposed to be in afghanistan for a short period of time  we're now going to be there for close to 19 years  it's time to bring them home  it's time to bring them home  it's true  time to bring them home  we've done our job  we've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat  and now we are  we are policing  we are now policing  that's what we're doing  we're policing  and that  as i said  no more respect for the police  but these are military people  and those are police  but we are now policing  we're not fighting  we're policing  and you know what  after all of these years 窶ｦ one other story  and i have to tell you  i go to walter reed on friday  and i do it quite often  i gave out five purple hearts  and i meet people that are so beautiful  so amazing  i met five warriors  and one was so badly hurt  with the loss of arms and a leg  another one 窶ｦ they're just very  very devastated  but these are great  great people  and i gave out the purple heart  and i see the parents  and i have to say  walter reed  i want to just say  the doctors there  the job they do  you know  you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets  and the vets' care  and nobody's done better  we got choice for the vets  we did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible  but i saw these young men  and i gave them their purple hearts  and their parents were there crying  and one of them was so amazing  i said  ""what's your problem "" ""sir  my face was blown apart  my nose was absolutely just blown apart "" he said  ""sir  it's incredible "" and i looked at him  i said  ""that's the most beautiful nose i've ever seen  what do you mean "" he said  ""a doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field  he said there were a thousand fragments "" now i don't know if that's right  but well  a lot  he meant a lot  ""he said there were a thousand fragments  he rebuilt my nose with glue  he glued the bones together  he rebuilt my nose "" i say  ""you have the most beautiful nose i've ever seen "" and it's true  and his father came over to me  he said  ""sir "" father was crying  he said  ""sir  honestly  my son looks better now "" he said  ""my son did not have a good look  he knows  now look at it  it's beautiful  it's beautiful "" but these doctors at walter reed  and these army  and marine  and the medical doctors  they are unbelievably great people  and they see sights that you and i hopefully will never see  they see things that nobody will ever see  and there's nobody like them  and i have to give a shout out to those people  there's nobody like them  so in the case of turkey  and syria  and the kurds  we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with turkey  no  you don't want to do that  we could hit turkey very hard financially  or we could mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds  i like that  you know  let's mediate a deal  but remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years  and we were artificially put there  in this case by president obama  so we did our job  we knocked out  and i'll tell you another thing  we have to be treated fairly  we have to be treated fairly  we're not treated fairly by other nations  we captured many  many isis fighters  most of them came from europe  they came from germany  they came from france  they came from all of these countries  and we called them  i called them myself in many cases  i said  ""take your fighters "" they said  ""we don't want them  you take them "" i said  ""no  no  no  we did you a big favor  they're citizens of germany  they're citizens of france  they're citizens of these various countries in europe  take your fighters "" ""we don't want them  sir  we don't want them ' and i said  ""how unfair are we treated  we do them a great favor  and they won't take the fighters "" so we're doing some things that are pretty amazing  every once in a while you have to change course  and do what you have to do  the united states has spent  8 trillion in the middle east  we've lost thousands of brave soldiers  and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people  great people  their lives will never be the same  these wars produced only chaos and bloodshed  and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed  made the middle east  really it's less safe  it's less stable  and it's less secure  and i say it all the time  the single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the middle east  we spent  8 trillion and lost thousands of lives  and by the way  the other side  we can talk about that  lost millions of lives  what did we do  so we're going to pull them out  and we're pulling people out  and we're trying to make good deals  and we're going to bring our soldiers back home  and we may need them for something else  and they'll be ready  previous administrations lust for regime change  and also put historic christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started  they are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures  the christians  the christians  and we work hard with the christians  we have tremendous evangelical support  we work hard with the christians  so we're slowly getting out of the middle east  we're doing it carefully  and we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before  when i came into office  a very prominent general told me  because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone  said  ""sir  we have no ammunition "" we had old planes  we had planes that were so old  they didn't fly  we had people going to the desert  the plane graveyards  airplane graveyards  picking up parts  i never want to hear a president of the united states hear those words again  i never want to have a president hear the words  ""sir  we have no ammunition "" think of that  think of that  now  thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military  we have more ammunition  more missiles  more rockets  more tanks  more fighter jets  and more of everything else than we've ever had before  and we have no choice  you look around the world  and we have no choice  unfortunately  and the democrats want to dismantle our military  after years of building up other countries  we are finally building up our country  that's what we have to do  we're replacing the disaster known as nafta with the brand new u s -mexico-canada agreement  usmca  a giant victory for our farmers  ranchers  workers in minnesota  congress should pass usmca immediately  we hope that nancy pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense  and to protect our industrial backbone  i placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel  i'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from china  and the supply chain of china  which was unbreakable  is now breaking wide open  and they understand that  and i don't blame china for what's taken place over the last 25 years  i blame the people that led our country that let that happen  where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build china  it's not china's fault  in the previous administration  they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key  including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called superior national forest  last year  i traveled to duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice  reopening superior national forest  and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of minnesota  tremendous jobs  and now the iron range is back in business  the last time i was here  a man came up to me  he said  ""sir  president obama took our heart away  took our life away ' i'll never forget it  a man  strong guy  had tears in his eyes  he said  ""you gave us back our life "" because they took it away from him  we gave it back  best iron ore there is anywhere  my administration is also fighting the democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate medicare  republicans will protect medicare  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  and for those of you that have private healthcare  health insurance  180 million people  they are going to end it  obliterate it  and most people are thrilled with it  we are going to leave it  you're going to have your plan the way you want it  and there's no plan like those plans  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up to the moment of birth  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion  because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant washington corruption  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and it's the party of the american dream  for years  you watched as your politicians apologized for america  you remember that  gee  i'm sorry  i'm so sorry  now you have a president who's standing up for america  we are standing up for minneapolis  and we are standing up for the great state of minnesota  we begin this political campaign with the best record  the best results  the best agenda  and the only positive vision for america  we begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country  together  we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work  from dependence to independence  and from poverty to prosperity  with your help  we will reelect  and we will elect a republican congress to create a safe  modern  fair  and lawful system of immigration  we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer  and ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years  nobody thought that could be done  going to be done  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work  and the sanctity of life  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our great national motto  in god we trust  we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history  our ancestors crossed the oceans  settled a continent  tamed the wilderness  revolutionized industry  pioneered science  won two world wars  defeated fascism and communism  and put a man on the face of the moon  proud citizens like the people of minnesota helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion  your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  winning  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  and ladies and gentlemen of minnesota  i will tell you this with great certainty  the best is yet to come  thank you very much  and just in concluding  together we will make america wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america safe again  and we will make america great again  thank you  minnesota  thank you ",Thank Thank Minnesota great state go win state short period time Thank feel like day election people inside set new record people love outside close

20,17,Sep,2020,datasets/Mosinee,"thank you  thank you very much  thank you very much  that is a beautiful site right behind me  isn't it  that's a beautiful site  thank you very much  and a very big hello  wisconsin  we've been very good together  and i'm thrilled to be with thousands of loyal  hard-working american patriots  47 days from now  we're going to win wisconsin and we're going to win four more years in the white house  this is the most important election in the history of our country  i feel that way so strongly  so do you  joe biden devoted his entire career to offshoring wisconsin jobs  outsourcing your factories  throwing open your borders  dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children's future to china  you know what he's been doing  i just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from anderson cooper  they don't ask me questions like that  and the audience isn't quite like this  do you see what his audience 窶ｦ they've got cars  they have car in a parking  it's the weirdest thing i've ever seen  and cnn is going  ""oh  this is so beautiful "" it's not beautiful  they have cars in a parking lot  what a deal  i'll tell you  what a deal  biden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century  including a nafta  china  you take a look at china's entry into the world trade organization and tpp  he supported them all  biden  surrendered your jobs to china and you know that  i probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for that  it was one of the big things  one of the big reasons i decided to say to my great wife  our first lady  let's go have some fun  let's go have some fun  she's done a great job and very popular  and the family is all over the place  all over the country  but unlike joe  who lets you down when he'd never even came back to milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects  i came to wisconsin and i've been here a lot since  since we started this  a lot  and you've been a tremendous beneficiary of what i've done and i have to  because you've been with me  you've supported me and we've had great victories together  all victories  so i want to thank you  now biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob  you see what's happening  if biden wins very simple  china wins  if biden wins  the mob wins  if biden wins  the rioters  anarchists  arsonists  and flag burners  they win and we're not into flag burners  we don't like flag burners  i'd like to say  pass a law  one year in jail  you started burning flags  we put you in jail for a year  we should do that  they would have done that  it's a different world  i guess  but it's sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we're for law and order  they say  don't use that term  it's too tough  no  everybody wants law and order  minorities want law and order  everybody wants law and order  they have to have it  i'm running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that's a continuation  because i don't know if you know it  the single greatest year wisconsin has ever had was last year  the second best year that wisconsin has ever had was the year before  and guess what the third was the year before that  and you're going to have your best year economically next year  it's all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by china  we want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to america  not to china  not to other very terrible forces out there  because if we win  very simply america wins  and that's what we want  we want this great country to win  over the last three and a half years  we've secured america's borders  fixed the disastrous trade deals  they have been the worst ever  not even 窶ｦ it was not even 窶ｦ when i looked at these  i studied them and i used to talk about them  they had to be bad  when i started studying  i said  ""who are the people that made these deals ""2 grossly incompetent people  brought back our manufacturing jobs  rebuilt the awesome power of the u s  military and obliterated the isis caliphate  we open obliterated it  obama was not able to do it  he wasn't able to come close  it was just announced that in 2019  before the virus came in from china  we grew median income by a record of  4 400 in just one year  achieving the highest median income in u s  history  that's in the history of our country  in the first three years  we lifted six point six million people out of poverty  the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country  that's not bad  and i didn't even make these numbers up  these are numbers that 窶ｦ they sound good to me  we built the greatest economy in the history of a world  this is the greatest economy in the history of the world  and then the virus came in  we closed it down  we saved millions and millions of lives  we'd be at two and a half million  two million  three million  a number that would not be sustainable  would not be acceptable  a horrible number  there shouldn't have been one person that died  it should have been stopped at china  they stopped it for their country  but it came out to us  to europe  to the rest of the world  188 countries  we will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year  and it could be very  very soon  you've been seeing what's going 窶ｦ could be very  very soon  could be  it's amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine  when they thought it couldn't be done  they said  ""well  he's got to get a vaccine "" and then all of a sudden  they're looking like it's going to be very close  we're doing great  we're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics  remdesivir  all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down  like at numbers that nobody can believe  but we have three vaccines right now  they're in the final stage  clinical trials  we worked it for the fda where they approved it fast  they went very fast  very quick  at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved  no other administration  certainly the last one  because the last one was grossly incompetent  in fact  that's why i'm here  because if it was good  i wouldn't have run  if they did their job  i wouldn't have run  i was very happy in my other life  i was very happy  but i'm very happy in this life  more happy  because nobody has produced in three and a half years  the first three and a half years  nobody has done what we have been able to do  nobody  so we'll defeat the virus and next year will be truly  i think  from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints  maybe the best year of all  hard to believe we're going so fast  the numbers have been incredible  we've had employment numbers  the best ever  we've had retail sales numbers the best ever  you see them all  they come out every day  and our stock market is for the most part  at a new high  and if people have 401ks  if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels  i think you should vote for sleepy joe  because he's going to raise your interest  he'll be raising your interest rates  i watch him though  he's denying all this up  everything that he said  he's now denying  he said  no fracking  right  there will be no fracking during the 窶ｦ he didn't know what fracking was  but he said there's no fracking  the reason is because everybody else  all of the radical left candidates up there  they couldn't get too far left  so joe agreed  then he gets the nomination  now they're all angry  you know that crazy bernie  all of the left democrats  they don't want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking  he said  ""well  now we can do some fracking "" but remember this in politics  it's always the thing that they say first  that's what they're going to do  no guns  no religion  no energy  no oil  remember that  remember  he put beto in charge of his gun policy  right  beto  crazy beto  remember when beto went out  he said  ""i was born for this "" and that's when it all came down  as soon as i heard that  anybody said they were born for this  that doesn't play well  but he's in charge of the second amendment  and you won't have a second amendment  frankly  you wouldn't have a second amendment if i didn't get elected  it would have been obliterated  it would have been torn up  maybe it would have been totally knocked out  but there's tremendous pressure on your second amendment  as long as i'm here  you'll always have a second amendment  but i want to just say  they do disinformation  they make up a phony story and then they go with it  they make up a totally phony story  it's called disinformation  and one of the things  oh  what they did  the worst of all was the soldiers  because  nobody loves our soldiers like i do and they made up a phony deal  and that's why i say the gloves are off because when they do that  that's worse than what i'm going to talk to you about  that's big 10  you know we got it back  right  we got big 10  but the soldier story  about standing over their graves  you know the one i'm talking about  then they do a commercial  and i said  the good news about that is the gloves are off  i can now call him grossly incompetent  the man is incompetent  he's been there for 47 years  he didn't do a thing  now all of a sudden  in years where he was never considered smart  but now he's really not considered smart  and now all of a sudden he's going to do what he never did in 47 years  he's got to do this and that and everything that i'm doing  everything that we're doing  but i want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon  oh  i hope your team does well after all that  i hope that team does well  but i especially want to thank a football legend  he was great  wisconsin's own barry alvarez  he was great  good  got to be careful when you do that  a lot of times you don't like people too much  they say  ""oh "" but he's a good man  we worked with him  we worked with a whole group  including the commissioner of the league  did a very  very good job  did a very good job  but we called them  and the reason is that they took an ad  in other words  another one  disinformation  they took an ad saying i was against football  i'm the one that said they shouldn't close  but i said that  if they close  they close  but then they took an ad saying i'm the one  i didn't want it  i wanted it closed  so then i said  ""well  no  i don't  i want it open  let me call up the commissioner "" we called up the commissioner and he was great  he said  ""you really think so "" and bottom line  we worked very hard  lots of calls to lots of different states  lots of people  we dealt with the players  the parents of the players  who are really the boss  that's okay  i won't say that  but these are players that have a shot at the nfl  they have a shot at pro-football  we want the nfl to proudly stand when they sing our national anthem  or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend  down 27%  because people don't want that  you know what  we have enough politics  right  we have politics here  we have politics all over  in fact  sometimes i have to turn it off  i can't do it anymore  i can't watch me  it's always 窶ｦ i can't watch me  i can't watch  but no  we have enough politics  we don't want to watch now on sunday  all  here we go again with the politics  let them play football  let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great american flag  and then go home to the mansion and have a good time  take a nice sauna and then if you want  after you recover  you come out and you go and you do your thing  whatever the thing may be  but people don't want to see it and the ratings are down  here we go again  i thought we taught them that lesson two years ago  didn't we think  i thought we taught that lesson  but biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy  i know this state very well  it's one of the reasons i made the great deal with canada and mexico  but canada  because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products  you had a 287% tariff on your dairy products with canada  people don't realize canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until i came along  very  very unfairly  did you know that  287  but i saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back  they had something called specialty milk  does anybody know what that is  right  you know  a lot of people 窶ｦ it's a small little grouping of milks  specialty milk  but this was the final straw  and i met some people and canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else  and they raised a tariffs massively  they made it impossible  they tried to take over that business too  along with all of them  it was just massive and horrible what they did  and that really got me going  the little specialty milk  specialty products  a small portion  but you know what  that was it  and we have a great deal  the usmca is a great deal and i'm very honored to have done it  but it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by canada  you know  they have the wonderful  oh  canada  we love to hear the song  right  but let me tell you  they are very tough  and they've taken advantage of our country for many  many years  and i will tell you this  they're not so happy now  but at least they got a deal  but you're happy  and it's about time you were happy  you now have a great deal and you're not going to have your companies leaving for mexico anymore or canada  and you're not going to have them make your product in mexico or canada  send it over here with no tariff  with no tax  where we lose tax  we lose jobs  we lose our companies  we lose everything  and they make a lot of money selling the product to us  same product  so we're not doing that stuff anymore  there's a tremendous disincentive  it's called  like  let's not do it  and you haven't seen that lately  you haven't seen too many companies leaving have you  it's sort of an amazing thing  it's a little bit like what we did with the statues  so on the statutes  they were knocking them down three or four months ago  i said  ""do we have any laws  no  but there was a very old law "" i said  ""what was it "" you get 10 years in jail  10 years in prison  they actually use the word prison  which is a tough word  you get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument  i said  ""let me see that law  i want to see that law "" right  glen  right  i want to see that law  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you very much  so big tax cuts  big regulation cuts  the democrats  they want to 窶ｦ the democrats  they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations  do you notice what's happening with japan  you notice what's 窶ｦ we have taken billions and billions of dollars in from china  we charge them a fortune  in fact  many farmers in this group  because you got to love trump  i gave you  28 billion  right  thank you very much  china  right  you were targeted  12 billion  sonny purdue  secretary of agriculture  i said  ""sonny  how much have they been hit for  targeted for "" remember when china said we're not going to do anything  we're not buying  they thought they were going to put pressure on us  sonny said  ""sir  12 billion  the year before last and last year was 16  total of 28 billion "" we took 28 billion out of the tariffs  china never paid us 25 cents  not 25 cents with obama and biden  and in all fairness with no president  they paid us nothing  they pay us now tens of billions of dollars  i took a small portion of it  i added it up  16 and 12  28  and i said   28 billion is going to the farmers  did everybody get that money  right  you had a very good year  the farmers have had a very good year  last week  china ordered and you have to understand  i view china differently now than i did six months ago  we made a great trade deal but i view it differently because i don't know if i can ever view it the same  but last week they know how i feel and they're very smart  so instead of saying  we're not going to do business  which would have been okay with me  we would have worked it out somehow  you would have been very successful  the farmers  but last week  they had the largest order of corn  did you know this  in the history of our country  did anyone know this  the farmers  from china  thank you very much  the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country  and one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country  because they're very smart  somebody else would have said  well  let's not do business  and then it would have been easy for me  but they gave us so much  i have every farmer calling up saying  please do me a favor  we love this  we love this  this is a great deal  it's a great deal  but we feel differently about it  don't we  we just feel differently about it  i don't talk about it like i used to  i talked about it  it was great  and it turned out to be a great deal  but i don't talk about it the same way  at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties  two visions  two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties  you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other  on november 3rd  wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow biden and the democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike  ban american energy  confiscate your guns  which is what they want to do  shut down the economy  destroy the suburbs  you know they were destroying our suburbs  you know that  right  i don't know  if somebody said  you just doing okay in the suburbs  i said  ""how can i do okay  i saved the suburbs  what i've done is saved the suburbs "" and you know this  i don't have to go into it  but i saved the suburbs  i think the suburbs 窶ｦ last time  four years ago  ""oh  he's not going to do well with women "" i did great with women  they said  ""well a big thing "" remember that  no  but was that one of the greatest evenings ever  remember  and remember all the fake news  look at all the 窶ｦ oh la  that's a lot  that's a lot of people back there  look at that  the red lights are on  don't worry  i won't say anything bad about you cnn  because as soon as i see  as soon as i- because as soon as i see 窶ｦ as soon as i'm getting ready to say something about fake news  et cetera  et cetera  the lights start going off so i'm not going to 窶ｦ one just went off i think  you can tell by the lights  they got that little beautiful red light  you see it  but i won't say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they 窶ｦ remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible  actually these polls are very good compared 窶ｦ that was so bad it was like why did anybody vote  they're called suppression polls  they make them so bad that you lose all your appetite  you lose all your spirit  they take your guts out  and you don't go and vote  and your wife looks at you and says  ""darling i love that guy  but he's not going to win  he doesn't have a chance because the polls  he's down 10  he's down 20  he's down 50 points  darling  he can't possibly win  let's go have dinner and then we'll come home and watch his concession speech "" but my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote  instead  we watched her concession speech  crooked hillary  that was a real piece of work  remember when she was saying  ""will you accept the decision of the voters  will you accept that decision "" i wasn't perfect  i said i'll see how it works out  i should have said  ""yes  i will "" but i couldn't do that because i know how crooked she is  would you accept the decision  the anchor said to me like  ""will you accept "" they're coming after me  i said  ""you're supposed to be going after her a little bit too "" did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me  here we sit  is that air force one  yes  that's air force one  how did that happen  a lot of the times i'd say to the anchor  i'd say  ""wait a minute  wait a minute  this isn't fair "" i mean i'm watching what they're doing with biden where he's using teleprompters  ""move it up  move it up  i can't see  i can't see "" he's shot  he's shot  president xi of china is not shot  putin is not shot  kim jong-un  remember we're supposed to be in a war with him  what happened to the war  no  it seems to be good  did you see the middle east two days ago  remember our incompetent negotiator john kerry  he never got up to walk  the guy's getting beaten on every point  i say  ""walk  walk  get up and leave the table  you're giving up "" they'd say  ""we want this "" he'd say  ""well  i'd rather not "" ""we want this "" ""okay  you got it "" ""we want that "" ""you got it "" ""we want that "" say no and walk  they'll probably possibly call you back and if they don't that's okay too  but right now i will tell you iran  if we win  iran will be calling us within the first week  they're dying to make a deal  gdp down 27%  they don't have too much money for terror anymore  it's actually amazing  do you notice what's going on  now i don't want to speak too loud  but i did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way  any form  written instructions already done  we're going to hit them 1000 times harder than we've ever hit them before  so hopefully they will just come and we'll make a deal and they'll go back to being a rich country  let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon  they cannot  that deal was so bad that obama made   150 billion  they got  150 billion for nothing  you know the deal is practically 窶ｦ if i didn't terminate it which i'm proud to have done  but if i didn't terminate it  they got  1 8 billion in cash  how about that  if i didn't terminate that stupid deal  first of all you wouldn't have the deal in the middle east and all these countries are joining  it's happening fast  they want to all join  we did it  you know  the reverse  we did it the 窶ｦ thank you very much  thank you very much  you know it's interesting  thank you very much  i knew i like you  so the nobel peace prize  so the funny thing  a lot of people don't know because the fake news doesn't write about it  so if you're a president  right  and you are nominated for the nobel peace prize  you're the united states  no  but think of this  that's a big deal  i mean obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him  remember  he couldn't tell you why  he had no idea  to this day  he has no idea why he got it  but if you're a president and you get nominated  then two days later  you get nominated  did you know this  a second time  for a different deal  kosovo  serbia  they've been killing each other for hundreds of years  i stopped a lot of death and i did it like easy  it wasn't hard for me  it's sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing  but you know what  they did a check  so i got nominated twice for the nobel peace prize  that's a big deal  i don't know  i should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things  but these are for two different deals  and not one mention was made on the evening news  think of it  i got rid of the prosecutor  here's the billion  right  but they don't want to play that too often  you have to look around for it  it's a very unfair deal but as the expression goes  we won  i don't know how the hell we did it  when you look at the opposition  when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well  you look at how unfair it is  it's pretty damn good  but we have a lot of support  we have tremendous support of the people  these rallies  look at this rally  these rallies 窶ｦ these rallies are incredible gap ever polled  i'm not a believer in the polls but i believe that one  it's the biggest enthusiasm gap  he's got no enthusiasm  the only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us  they want to beat me  that's the only thing he's got  the people that want to 窶ｦ they couldn't care less about him  he could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground  biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom  earlier today i took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to america's youth  the parents know all about it  i checked  they're doing it in wisconsin too  i was a little surprised  i'm a little surprised  i'm a little surprised you let it happen actually but we're going to get rid of it  i announced that we're launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission  we're going to teach our children the truth about america  that we're the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we're getting better every single day  sleepy joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left  he even opposed sending the national guard into a place called kenosha  did you ever hear of kenosha  how about that  did we do a good job  i wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor's okay  we have to do that if 窶ｦ we got to get the governors to say please do it  how they don't do it  how they don't do it in some other places when you look at what's going on with chicago  right  when you look at what's going on with portland  those are just anarchists  you know how long it would take us to fix up portland in terms of ending it all  i'd say far less than an hour  i'd say a half hour  look what we did at minneapolis  we're doing well in minnesota because they saw what happened  now they shouldn't have allowed it to go on for 11 days  they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night  nice evening  a little problem  there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said  ""no  this is a peaceful protest "" i don't know if it's your state but a couple of them they have 窶ｦ you're allowed to protest  so you can't go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets  of main street  of 5th avenue  break up the stores  burn down the buildings  climb over each other's face  you can climb right over their face  you don't have to wear masks  you don't have to do anything  25 000 people walking down the street  looters  anarchists  agitators  burning down stores  throwing things at police  they've taken the authority away from our police  our great police  they've taken their authority and their dignity away  we're giving it back  we have to  we have to  by the way  i was endorsed by new york's finest and we're with them all the way  i was just endorsed two days ago by chicago police  i think that takes courage  right  philadelphia  florida  texas  everybody  ohio  i don't know  did anybody 窶ｦ is there one group of 窶ｦ even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police  did anybody endorse sleepy joe  i don't think so  but we did a great job in kenosha  we got out there  i went there as you know  a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would 窶ｦ it would have been burned to the ground  they did damage  we should have gone in  i wanted to go in the first night  we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in minnesota  again  if they would have called us early it would have been over  portland  i'd love to go there  that would be so easy  you know in seattle  they heard we were coming in  they gave up  they heard we 窶ｦ i said  ""that's enough  we're going in  i don't care  we're going in "" ""do you have permission "" ""no  we're going in "" they took over a chunk of the city  and when they heard we were going in it's like  ""well we give up  that's it "" that was the end of the settle problem  it's a terrible thing that's going on  all in democratic run  super liberal run  cities  the red cities are doing great  i think we're doing great all over  the republican cities  we're fair  we're not stupid  how stupid these people are  did you see chicago  48 people shot  six died  you know we're in afghanistan  we're pulling the troops  you know that  we're coming back  we're almost finished  we're pulling 窶ｦ finally  these endless wars  these endless wars  and we had to fight other things but we've done a great job but we're acting like a police force over there  no  we're pulling the troops  we're almost out of iraq  that's another one  we're down to about 2 000 troops  did you know that sean  2 000 troops  so syria  we're out but we kept the oil so we have some 窶ｦ was it okay that we at least kept the oil  i feel badly because we have some troops 窶ｦ ""well you haven't pulled the troops "" no no  we're gone  we pulled all the troops out of syria  remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between syria and turkey  i said  ""why are we doing that "" they said  ""well  we are "" i said  ""wait a minute  we have an army of 100 000 here  an army of 25 000  30 000 here  we got 5 000 soldiers  that's a very dangerous position to be in "" i don't like it  they've been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years  why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border  we want to guard our own borders  right  where we're doing very well  where we're doing very well  we're doing great on our southern border  i hate to say this  but that wall is going up very rapidly  10 miles a week  we're up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon  you think that was easy  that was not easy  our great congressman over here  that was not easy  the democrats were totally in favor of the wall until i said when i came in  ""we will build the wall "" as soon as i said it  they were against the wall  they said  ""we don't want you to build the wall  walls don't work "" i said  ""no no  walls always work "" you know what else works  the wheel  the wheel and the wall  you can go back  come back in 1 000 years from now  the only two things i know for sure  you're going to have a wheel and you're going to have a wall  the computers  they come up with a brand new computer  it's genius  12 days later  it's obsolete  but walls are never obsolete  neither are wheels  so i made one mistake and i tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me  the congressmen  they were incredible actually  i tell it to them  i should have said instead of we will build the wall  we will build the wall  we will build 窶ｦ then the democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money  i can build like 10 walls with all the money we have  it's the craziest thing  maybe we'll build it double thick or we'll go twice as high  no  but the wall is great  everything  everything  that they wanted  but i made one mistake  i should have said  ""we will not build a wall "" then they would have insisted that we build it  i could have saved two years of litigation  ""we will not build a wall under any circumstances "" then pelosi would say  ""we demand that you build a wall "" these people are terrible  crazy nancy  crazy as a bedbug  she's crazy as a bedbug  she decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor  how did that work out  not too good  it didn't work out too well  can you imagine  the owner of the beauty parlor is a maga lady  she loves trump  can you believe it  i don't know what it is but i think if i owned a beauty parlor  i had a customer  i'm not sure i'd be turning her in  the owner turned nancy in  that's a lot of hate  that's serious hate  right  no  she's a great owner  as far as i'm concerned  i think she's fantastic  she's for us  they said  ""what made you do it "" you know what she said  ""because i see how hard our president has to work  i see what they put him through  i see what he puts with and i turned her in "" how about that  how about that  we love her  she can do my hair anytime  i think i'm going to call her in  check it out  maybe you can do something  maybe you can improve it  it's not bad though  i have friends that 窶ｦ i have friends my age  they're not looking too good  instead of standing up for america  joe biden and the democrats  they condemn america and war is always waged on our great law enforcement  we love our law enforcement  kamala harris  that's another great beauty  kamala harris  that's a beauty  remember  i tell this story all the time  when you pick somebody  you pick somebody that's hot  that's going in the right direction  right  she came out  she was at like 14  15 in the polls  and she started going down  down  down  it never stopped  it drove her crazy  she was terrible at the debates  wait till you see what 窶ｦ i don't want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what mike pence does to her in the debates  but i don't want to put 窶ｦ i don't want to put pressure on mike  do we have a great vice president  is he good  he's great  and he loves this state  loves all the states actually  he's just a great american but do you remember his last debate  what he did to that character from virginia  that one wasn't good  the other guy's jumping around  mike is just sitting there  we love america  we're going to lower your taxes  thank you  you win  no  mike is great  but kamala harris and 13 members of biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters  take them out of jail  get them out of jail as soon as possible  including one who attempted to murder a police officer  a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl  this is what we're dealing with  this is what we're dealing with  you know kamala was considered  is considered further left than crazy bernie  think of that  they got there 窶ｦ i mean seriously  watch  you know the manifesto that biden and 窶ｦ it's not biden  biden has not agreed to anything  his people  his representatives  because biden doesn't know he's alive  let's not kid ourselves  biden  biden didn't agree  he didn't  they just told him what's happening  they said  ""listen  you're against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out  elizabeth warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed "" pocahontas  you know pocahontas  did anybody ever hear of her  she's another great one  pocahontas  i said to her a long time ago  i've got more indian blood in me than you do and i have none  i have none  sadly  i'd love a little bit of it  but i have none  i said 窶ｦ i turned out to be right  she choked and she went for a blood test  remember  was it 1024th  meaning maybe nine hundred years ago  there was a little action going on  crazy pocahontas  she's a nasty one though  isn't she  she's a terrible person  i was hoping that she'd win so we could go after her because i think kamala is not as smart but she's a little bit less vicious  i think this  the one who treated sleepy joe the worst was kamala  she accused him of metoo  she accused him of everything  she accused him of 窶ｦ that he was a racist  right  that he was a racist  because what he's done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing  she's accused him of everything under the book  the busing  remember  the busing scandal  so i said brilliantly he'll never pick her because she was too terrible to him  she was the worst of everybody  by far  i would say  but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history  it's not going to matter  and that is no way for a woman to become the first president  that's for sure  if a woman is going to become the first president of the united states  it can't be her  that would rip our country apart  this is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor  this would not be what people want  especially because it's her  biden has called to end cash bail  you know that right  for vicious criminals  meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else  you're right back on the street the next day  he called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy  he says they're the enemy and he just thinks it's terrible  he think it's terrible  now he's liking the police much more  it's a little late  remember  first instinct  that's where they're going  and he has no choice because he has to  because again  i was going to say  the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the green new deal  getting rid of your planes  no more airplane trips  remember the crazy senator from hawaii  ""do you like the green new deal "" ""i love it very much "" he said  oh okay  well you're the senator from hawaii  that's right  the beautiful island of hawaii  she said  ""under the green new deal you basically can't fly in an airplane "" ""oh that's a problem "" so they said they'd build a bridge from the mainland to hawaii  it's 2 000 miles long but these are minor details  remember her when they explained to her that planes are out  cows are out  cows  they don't want cattle  they don't want cows  did they withdraw that one  that was a tough one  wasn't it  they don't want cows  bad for the ozone layer  who would even think of that  you'd got to be sick to even think it  okay  give me a break  give me a break and i guess under that theory this big guy is next  he's next  no  it's a sick deal going on there  to do it the way they want would cost  100 trillion  that's more money than this country could earn in 1 000 years to do it right  "" we don't like that building  the windows are too large "" ""okay  let's rip it down and build a new one "" what windows are you going to have  you're not going to have windows anymore  environmental  they love wind too  right  the big windmills  i always say  the greatest graveyard in the world for birds  just walk under a windmill  you will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine  what's happening  including eagles  you know  in california they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle  right  you go to jail  right  these windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long  it's unbelievable  and yet they want wind  and wind also is very  it's very hard to store the electricity from wind  so if you go home and you want to watch television because president trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant state of the union addresses  if the wind isn't blowing  the husband looks at the wife  says  ""darling  i'm sorry  you can't watch tonight  the wind is not blowing "" ""sorry  you can't watch tonight  the wind is not blowing "" and she looks at me  ""i like the old days  it's much better "" but the rhetoric of biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger  last weekend  two los angeles sheriff's deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range  and we have everybody looking for that creep that did it  i called him an animal the other night  i said  ""he's an animal "" and we were challenged by some people on the left  ""he's not an animal  he's a human being "" he's not a human being  they got to find him  they got to find him  and the penalty has to be very fast  very swift and very  very severe  you can't do that  we call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman  you know that  right  but the anti police demonstrators  they cheered and cheered when they saw this  and then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital  as president  i'll always support the heroes of law enforcement and i'll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty  they want prisoners to vote too  they wanted to  i said  ""so what about the boston bomber "" remember bernie sanders  he wanted all prisoners to have  and i said  ""does that mean everybody "" ""yes "" so we sent in a question  ""does that include the boston bomber  is he entitled to a vote "" and even bernie is going  ""oh man  let's get into a different question  this is not a good question "" but we want to get that  we want to take care of it  if you look at all of the problems that we have  you look at crime  even somebody brought it up today  we're doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus  you know how many names we have  like 22 different names  i call it the china virus  we're doing a great job  but if you want to really see a great job  take new york and some of these other democrat run states out of it  you'll see numbers that are unbelievable because new york had a very  very hard time  a lot of bad things happened  but you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers  but by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics  we've done an incredible job  including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built  and i think our task force has been incredible  and mike pence has done a great job  biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers  biden says he wants to protect black lives  but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of african american citizens  the democrat party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in democrat controlled cities  yet biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide  they ask him  ""what about nationwide  what about the fact that you just had your democrat national convention "" where  by the way  we had far many more viewers  millions and millions of more viewers  we had millions of more  i thought it was a great thing  did anybody hear herschel walker that night  it was 窶ｦ well  you talk about a good football player  he was some player  what a great guy  but all of them  everybody  the first lady did great  ivanka did great  they all did  they did great  we had some 窶ｦ and some incredible stories  some very sad stories when you look and see what happened  but biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists  my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists  joe biden is a weak person  he's always been a weak person  and that was in prime time  and prime time was 25 years ago  and let me tell you  he's not old  i always defend him on this  i have friends that are 85  89  92  95  and they're 100%  there's just something wrong with joe  he's off  okay  he's off  and i have no problem saying it anymore when i watch the disinformation  because this is not disinformation  this is fact  if he's elected  his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets  they'll be running the department of justice  department of homeland security  the department of education  and most importantly  they will put many judges on the united states supreme court  we can't have that  we'll have a totally different country  radical left judges  and that has to do with the second amendment  it has to do with right to life  it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down  and they'll have one  two  three or four  whoever is the next president  and hopefully  that's going to be us  not me  us  it's us  but i put it  and think of this  by the end of the term  we'll have approximately 300 brand new  great federal judges  court of appeals judges 300  which is a record  300  give or take a little  tiny bit  but 300  nobody thought that was possible  i want to thank president obama  he left us 142 openings  nobody gets left one opening  a federal judgeship is a big deal  nobody gets left any openings  he gave us 142 openings  thank you very much  what happened  they thought hillary was going to win  so they didn't push it  and then they said  ""wait a minute  these polls are getting a little close at the end "" and they tried like hell to get some judges approved  but it didn't work  that's what happens  you got to go and you have to act fast  you got to get it done  get it done  right  we get things done like nobody's ever gotten it  oh  he was a great president  he was great  he left 142 judges for the republicans  he was a great president  right  if you are of that side of the plate of that ideology  and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships  i don't think you'd rate him as doing a good job  hey  look at what happened in iraq  look at what happened with isis  look at what happened with our military  look at what happened with our vets  our vets are better taken care of now than they've ever been in the history of our country  but never forget they are coming after me because i am fighting for you  and that's true  that's true  and we're winning the fight and we're winning this election  this election  we are doing well  they refuse to say it  they refuse to say it  and they hate to say it  it just drives them crazy  but that night  remember they started off by saying  ""this will be a very short evening for donald trump "" that was donald trump in those days  now  it's president trump  i lost all my friends because of this position  i had friends  ""hey  don  let's go to dinner "" ""okay  good  richard  i'll go "" hey  don  let's go "" ""okay  larry  i'll see you later  i'll meet you at a restaurant in new york "" everybody was nice and loose  you could have a great conversation  and you don't want to know what we talked about  it's just none of your business  but we were loose  all of a sudden  i'd become president of the united states  and these are a lot of 窶ｦ i know a lot of important people  actually  the people i like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful  i always say  never go out with a successful person  you'll understand  but i know a lot of very successful people  very  very successful  and now they call me up  ""mr  president  sir  would you like to get together sometime "" i say  ""loosen up  yes  call me donald  you've known me for 30 years  call me donald "" ""oh  thank you so much  thank you  mr  president  i appreciate it "" i lost all my friends because it's respect for the office  let's face it  it's different  they used to be loose  they used to be great  you could sit back  i'm not a drinker  but you could sit back and have a drink  whatever the hell you're drinking  and now  you can't do that anymore  you can't do it anymore  so i have to rely on people in congress to be my friends  and we just happened to have a couple tonight  and one of them who's been a great warrior and he's doing a fantastic job  i just saw you on television by the way  bryan  does everybody know bryan steil  bryan steil  young  handsome  but a warrior  when the fake impeachment happened  it was a total fake  what did we finish up with the republicans  197 to nothing  right at the house  one night  it was a fake impeachment  i got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of ukraine  who i never met before  if you're going to do something  at least know him a little bit  right  i never met him  and then they said it was eight times  quid pro quo  that was adam schiff  shifty schiff  right  and he went before congress and he repeated my conversation  except that he made it all up  remember he repeated it  and then i said  ""ah  fortunately  we had that whole thing essentially recorded "" i'm glad i did  but these are very deceptive  deceiving  sick people  and i said  ""well  he lied because there was no quid pro quo "" it was a perfect conversation  but by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it  and nancy pelosi was all set  she loved doing it  she from day one  but she thought it was what schiff said  when she saw the conversation  she said to her people  ""what the hell did you get me into "" so they could have dropped it  but they said  ""let's give it a shot "" he's another beauty  mitt romney  he's a real beauty  he couldn't get elected dog catcher right now in utah  so we have another great one and he's really a friend of mine  and he's been solid  he loves his country and he loves his state  glenn grothman  glenn  thank you very much  friend  and a man who just got elected  and he's from an area that i know very well  we did very well  we got our big  big  fat  beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs  but he was taking a legend's place  so it's never easy to replace a legend  that's duffy  in case anybody 窶ｦ and they was running and we did a lot of work for him  and it was great  and he reacted very well under pressure  a lot of people don't react well under pressure  they choke  they choke  he was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points  and now  he's your congressman  he's doing a great job  you got to vote for all these people on november 3rd  tom tiffany  thank you  tom  and we have a great congressional candidate  derrick van orden  where's derrick  derrick  good luck  i hear good things  derrick  you got my total support  i hear very good things  i could only be supportive  our record is like 222 and three  so i don't like to have a loss  and i support you a 100%  you know that  you have my total endorsement  all right  i hear you're fantastic  all right  and your former congressman who i hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it  especially his wife  rachel deserves it  she's just fantastic  he's fantastic because i know he's coming back into government in some form  he can come with us  he can stay here  he can maybe run for governor or maybe do something  sean duffy  sean duffy  no  but he was the world champion tree climber  and i love sports  right  anytime you know the world champion at anything  but especially that  and i'll never forget  i was asking about it  ""how was it was "" he said  well  he broke his back numerous times  he broke a lot of bones  i said  ""let me ask you a question  how much harder was it to go up the tree than down "" he said  ""it was easy going up "" the hard part was coming down because if he missed  that was where the danger was  right  that was where the danger  but many times  world champion  could you still do it today  ""a little bit heavier "" he said  you got to carry a little bit more weight  that's all right  that's not a good sign though  right  anyway  great job  we love having you rachel  thank you very much  you are a friend  fox and friends  and plenty of other places  right  a lot of personality  a lot of personality  rachel  she's been our friend from day one  i think from day one  and her fantastic family too  tonight  we're also praying for everyone in the path of hurricane sally  we're out there working very hard  we are working in florida and alabama and georgia  we have fema  we have everybody there  we just finished in 窶ｦ take a look  we just went to louisiana  texas  we're getting hit by some big hurricanes  but we have it under control  really good  our coast guard has been fantastic  by the way  unbelievable  the bravery  they go into these storms  they go into these storms  they say  ""how dangerous is it "" ""sir  it's very dangerous "" i say  ""yeah  all right "" he said  ""would you like to try it sometime "" i say  ""admiral  no  thank you  i'll take a pass "" i think they might have a problem with me doing it  but i will tell you  they are 窶ｦ in texas  they saved 16 000 people two years ago  the coast guard  us coast guard  i think there's no brand to me  that's gone up more than the us coast guard  so it's great that we're getting them new ships  those ships are all coming in  nice new ones  all built in the usa  beautiful ones  most of them have already arrived  my administration will be by their side through every step  we're working again  very  very hard in the panhandle  the panhandle  we love the panhandle  it got hit hard  we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years  we passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts  nobody's ever done more  more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family  we've virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax  also known as the death tax  so if you die in 100 years from now  and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand 窶ｦ is anybody here they have children that they don't like  or perhaps can't stand  because if you do  don't listen to the rest of this  but if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever  they were being put out of business  they'd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax  the death tax  and it was a terrible thing  we got rid of it  so now you can leave your farm  your small business to your family  and just hope they remember you every once in a while  it's always a difficult situation  but it was  it was ruining farms  they'd have to go out and sell the farm  they'd have to go out and get partnerships  they'd have to go out and borrow money from banks  and then all of a sudden they're in foreclosure proceedings and they've never done that before  they don't have to worry about that anymore  if you love your family  that's a big deal  they've been trying to get that  sean  for what  30 years they've been trying to get that  right  especially for the farmers  because it's that kind of a business  it's a great business  but it's day to day  you have a bad crop  all of a sudden you can't pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax  right  and they lose their farm  so we're not going to have that anymore  we achieved american energy independence for the first time  totally independent  we don't have to be in those far away places unless we want to be  biden pledged to abolish american oil  american jail  clean coal  natural gas  he said the fracking  i told you that  but we're not going to let him get away  we'll be bringing that up on occasion  for 47 years  joe biden crushed the dreams of wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries  that's what happened  before i got here  what was happening with japan  and we pay our deep respects to prime minister abe of japan  a great friend of all of ours  a great friend of mine  he's going to be leaving office very soon  like in a matter of a day  and he was a great gentleman  he's a tough negotiator  i'll tell you that  he made very good deals against the united states  but he's somebody that's going to be missed  he's a great gentleman  he championed every special interest  biden  every special interest  and he sold out on trade  he sold out like almost nobody ever before  earlier this year  i kept my promise to american workers when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law  i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe  the trans-pacific partnership  you ever hear of that beauty  that would have really hit you  in 2017  i signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy american and hire american  i'm watching this biden and he's got his sign in front  ""buy american  oh  by american "" i've been saying that for like 20 years  right  where the hell has this guy been  they were actually accusing him of plagiarism  i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of wisconsin jobs  and it's all jobs  but you got hit particularly hard  biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging  he wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year  i fought like hell to keep them into the china deal and he wants to remove them  so tens of billions of dollars  billions and billions  i gave it to the farmers  i gave it to a lot of people  but i gave most of it by far  to the us treasury  he wants to take them off  so let me just ask you just a very innocent question  there's a young man  about four years old up front  i think he could give the answer  who do you think would like to have china  how do you think china would feel about this election  in one case  they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the us  we never got ever  25 cents from china  in the other case  he said  ""we're going to take them off "" i think they might be inclined to go for sleepy joe  this is like a dream for china  joe biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in the usa  it's very simple  so we did many things  not only china  not only the  28 billion farmers  we did so much and i'm proud to announce that i'm doing even more to support wisconsin farmers  starting next week  my administration is committing an additional  you've been asking for this for a long time   13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the china virus  including wisconsin's incredible dairy  cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly  been after that money for a long time  when the wisconsin timber industry was threatened  i imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products  saving many  many timber jobs in your state  if joe biden gets in  the radical left will shut down wisconsin's timber production for environmental reasons  do you believe that  oh  boy  it's so sad to see it  and that would happen  but we can't let that happen  we've come too far  we're so good  if that virus hadn't hit us  and it did  and it hit the whole world  but if it hadn't hit us  we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible  but it did  and we saved a lot of lives  they keep saying  ""oh  they just 窶ｦ"" by the way  if we had two people die  they would have said he did a terrible job  if we had 100 people die  if we had 1000  no matter what we do  we have trade deals  we announced a trade deal  everybody is saying how great it is  schumer and pelosi see it  they have no idea what the deal is  ""we don't like the deal "" did you look at it  ""oh  of course  we looked at it  it doesn't have tariffs  oh no  it does have tariffs "" they know nothing about the deal  automatically  anything we do  they just take the reverse  but you know what  i'd probably do it to them too  so i can't complain  and perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration  under my administration  we've achieved the most secure border in american history  we ended the catch and release  you know what catch and release is  you catch up them  they may be a killer  they may be a criminal at the highest order  you take their name  then you're supposed to bring them to a court  like perry mason  right  but we actually catch them  take their name  release them  say  ""come back in about four years for your court case "" we ended all this stuff  and you think that was easy  it wasn't easy  let me tell you  it was tough  but we have a really good  secure border  and the president of mexico has been terrific  we right now have 27 000 soldiers from mexico guarding our border  free of charge  we stopped asylum fraud  and we've deported 20 000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind  we're enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare  they have to sign a document  we invested  2  5 trillion in the us military  including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in marinette  how about that  i was there two months ago  marinette  that's a great company  but it was having a hard time  and now  they're building  what was that  like  6 billion worth of ships  and their beauties  they've started already  and we worked very hard on that  and we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one  because a lot of people wanted that contract  but we got it for wisconsin  remember that  we launched the first new branch of the united states armed forces in nearly 75 years  that's right  the space force  the fact is  and somebody said it on the other side  an opponent said whether you like it or not  trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign  like space force  that's a big deal  think of it  army  navy  air force  marine  窶ｦ think of it  army  navy  air force  marines  coast guard  right  think of it  i mean  that's all you heard your whole life  right  the army  the navy  the air force  the marines  coast guard  and now  we have the space force  you know what a big deal  first time in 75 years  it's a new one  last one was 75 years ago  the air force  right  that's a big thing  i never talked about that on the campaign  i never even thought about it  when i became president  i said  ""we have to do this "" because i saw what russia was doing  and i saw what china was doing  and  they've created their space forces  i said  ""what are we going to do  not have it "" it's going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that's where it's at  in terms of defense  in terms of offense  we passed va choice and va accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day  veterans satisfaction  91 percent  the highest score we've ever received  you haven't noticed  remember years ago  every story  every night  the nightly news  you'd always have horrible stories about the va  you don't see it anymore  now  i don't want to give them any ideas  because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy  i'm hurting myself by telling this story  this is not a good story  but remember that  every night you'd have these horror stories about the va  you don't see that anymore  91 percent approval rating  i kept my promise recognized the capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the middle east peace  and  you saw that two days ago  uae  bahrain  israel  nobody thought it was even possible  i saw john kerry on television the other day  ""it is not possible "" then we waited a little while  he went very  very strong  ""it is not possible "" and  it was not only possible  we have many countries that are joining us very soon  we killed the founder and the leader  the vicious leader of isis  al-baghdadi  we killed him  and  we also took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many  many troops and many people  all over the world  qasem soleimani is dead  he's dead  bad guy  bad guy  very bad guy  we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home  no one has been more wrong  more often than sleepy joe biden  he voted for the iraq war  he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military  i took over a military that was totally depleted  like  hillary clinton deleted  as opposed to depleted  she depleted them too  but  she deleted 33 000 emails  when is somebody going to pull the spring  ah  come on fellows  no  that's terrible  33 000 emails  try going to court sometime on a civil case  and when you go before the judge  he'll say  ""did you delete those emails "" ""did you get rid of those texts "" ""did you this窶ｦ  right "" and  now they caught weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation  and they cleaned their phones  how many were there  21  but they were like 33 phones  and yet  look what they do to general flynn  and some of these people that did nothing  they cleaned their criminals  yeah  that's criminal  it's criminal  they're criminals  they talk and talk and talk  they're criminals  they clean their phone  so you don't have any of the information  but that's a big problem for them  i would imagine  it's a disgrace that they can do it  but  hillary got rid of窶ｦ she deleted and acid-wash  right  who acid-washed  did you ever窶ｦ and  she also used to bang them with a hammer  remember that  we forgot that  right  so  let's see what happens with all of that stuff  i think bill barr's doing an excellent job  i have to tell you  and  he's fighting a very bad establishment in washington  there's some bad apples in that whole deal  but  if you think that biden opposed the mission to take out of osama bin laden  he was against it  he opposed the killing of soleimani  he oversaw the rise of isis  what a mistake  and  he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for america and the world  i don't think so  i don't think so  it's not been too positive  if it were up to sleepy  joe biden  bin ladin and soleimani  would be alive  isis would still be on the rampage and china would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close  i will tell you  we have weaponry  the likes of which nobody's seen  2 5 trillion buys you some good stuff  especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world  we have weapons  the likes of which nobody's seen  and just hope to god  we never have to use them  i say that  and i say  it's strongly  hope that we never have to use them  my attitude was that  and i've learned this a long time ago  by having them  we keep ourselves out of war  as opposed to bringing ourselves in war  but  we have built and created weapons  the likes of which this world has never seen before  and  we don't have to talk about it too much  nor do i really want to talk about it  when i ban travel from china  biden called it hysterical and xenophobic  he said  ""he's xenophobic "" what does that mean  joe  tell me  biden also opposed my plan to ban europe  i saw what was happening in france and spain and italy  and highly infected  we banned europe  if we had insisted and listened to joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing  which is  ""you don't have to do the ban "" hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died from the plague  biden was willing to sacrifice american lives  on the altar of open borders  and now  i hear him talking  he should have followed me  this guy did the swine flu  right  it was a catastrophe  and  the man that headed up the swine flu  i won't use his name because i'd like to have him have a nice evening  because i can't imagine the democrats are thrilled  he said  ""it was a horrible job  we had no idea what we were doing  it was a disaster "" he said  ""it was a disaster "" and now  biden's telling us how to do what we're doing so well on  what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job  and i got sleepy  joe biden  trying to tell me how to do it  and  his own man who headed it up  swine flu  it's h1n1 swine flu  joe called it  n1h1  i keep saying joe  joe  it's h1n1  right  i said  ""it's easier to remember because h comes before n "" but he can't do it  and then  you saw what he said the other day under a harris-biden administration  that was a disaster  i never said under a pence trump administration  he said  ""under a harris-biden administration "" and  what made it worse  is she said the same thing  that was terrible  right  sean  right  did you hear that  they are a disaster together  through our historic relief programs  we saved more than 1 million wisconsin jobs and 87 000 wisconsin businesses  that's not too bad  and  biden would demolish all of those games  and we've done similar things in other states  he would destroy your social security  totally destroy it  and destroy protections for preexisting conditions  they want to go to social medicine  they want to go to social窶ｦ you know that  right  you do know that  they want social healthcare where you don't窶ｦ remember obama 28 times  you can keep your doctor  you can keep your plan  that didn't work out too well  right  why haven't they looked into that one  28 times  well  under medicare for all  but it's basically socialized healthcare  you will never have your doctor  you will never have your plan  you'll have horrible healthcare  you're going to wait long times  long times  and  he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love  180 million plans  i don't think so  i don't think he's going to make it  how do you get elected  let's say you're doing  not only here  let's say texas  right  he's against oil  he's against god and he's against guns  that's a tough combination in texas  how does that apply  now  he's against religion  they won't open these blue states  they will not open your churches  they won't open them  and  i think they have an ulterior motive  one thing they have is  probably everything opens on november 4th  you understand that  and  they better be careful  those paper ballots you talk about  a bad thing  just get out and vote  get out and vote  and  if you have to go that route  make sure they have it counted  and  they know it's trouble  they just had another election today  fellows  where it's a disaster  the votes come in  they have no idea  they can't count them  and  i don't mean they're off by a little bit  they're off by 20 percent  25 percent  there's fraud  there's missing ballots  they have a woman in new york who is a terrible congresswoman  you know that  carolyn maloney  they gave her an election  they can't even find the ballots  and  they gave her a victory  and they cant find that the guy that is against her  who did very well  even though he's even more progressive  i don't even know what she is  i've known her for 25 years  i don't think she's progressive  i think she's whatever she has to be  but this guy  probably or possibly beat her  so  rightfully he's not too happy  and  they called the election for her and they can't find the ballots  wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens  you remember he raised his hand  that will totally drain your wonderful medicare  remember the question up there  he's standing up  "" who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens "" and  everybody raises their hands like fast  kamala was right up there  by the way  that will destroy your country  you do know that  because you can't afford it  and biden's looking around  ""oh  they all raise their hand "" he goes  remember  i remember  i said  ""well  there it goes  the election for him "" he's end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent  and  that's the deal he made with bernie sanders  opening the flood gates to terror  afflicted nations  but i predict the sanders people are going to vote for us  like they did the last time  we had a tremendous窶ｦ  because they love my stance on trade  because i know trade  and i was telling him much more so  than even bernie  but bernie  is right on that subject  that other countries  including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade  biden opposes  school choice and vowed to ban charter schools  did you know that  does everybody like charter schools  everybody likes choice  in the second term  i will provide school choice to every parent in america  we're all set up to get it done  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  and a limitless future for all americans  it's really a vote for the american dream  instead of letting washington change us  and  despite all that we've all gone through  we are changing washington  that's what's been happening  and  just in conclusion  and i hate concluding with you because i like you  i like you  i don't know why the hell i like wisconsin  but for some reason  you know what helps so  as you know for weeks before the election  she was four up  crooked hillary  four up  four up  four up  i kept saying  ""do you think we're going to win "" and i will say  sean duffy said  ""you're going to win "" he actually said  ""don't worry about it "" right  sean  i said  ""sean do you think we're going to win here "" i don't like these polls  but four down  he said  ""sir  you're going to win so easy "" and  early in the night  they said  ""donald trump has won the state of wisconsin "" and  so when i'm here  speaking in the freezing cold  i'm lucky they had窶ｦ i said  ""do you think we have窶ｦ "" it's very warm in new york and very warm in washington  it was hot actually  and i said  ""do you think we have a coat on the plane "" they said  ""yes "" i said  ""what's the temperature "" ""sir  it's 49 degrees "" i said  ""how about giving me a coat "" they have everything on air force one  that's the great thing  got more televisions in any plane in history  they've got televisions in closets  on floors  on ceiling  but  over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world  and  we will end our reliance on china once and for all  we'll make our medical supplies right here in the united states  and right here in the great state of wisconsin  we will rapidly return to full employment  that's happening very fast  soaring economies  and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was  last year  we will hire more police  increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement  surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities  and  we will ban sanctuary cities  which are deadly  we will appoint prosecutors  judges  and justices who believe in enforcing the law  not their own political agenda  we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech and the right to keep and bear arms  we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens  and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars  and  you remember with me  they thought because of my personality  they said  ""he'll be in war the first week "" what happened to the war  remember  we were going to be in war with north korea  hillary would have been in war with north korea  it would have been a nasty one too  but remember  everybody said  i was going to be in war  everybody said  ""oh  maybe i'll do something with social security "" and  i did  i saved it and made it stronger  and now  i'm going to make it even stronger  and  they're going to get rid of your social security because everything's going to come collapsing down  you will have a depression  if he gets in  they're going to raise interest rates  they're going to raise your taxes  you will have a depression  the likes of which this country has never seen before  and  your 401k's and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames  i just say it here  hopefully we're never going to experience it  but that's what's going to happen  we will maintain america's unrivaled military might  and we will ensure peace through strength  we will end surprise medical billing  require price transparency  which i've already signed  further reduced health insurance premiums  or the costs of prescription drugs  which are coming down now  you know  i signed favored nations clauses  their drug companies are not happy with me  i will tell you  they never thought it was possible and rebate clauses  they never thought anybody would do that to them  they made enough money for a long time  it's time  you got a big break  we will strongly protect medicare and social security  and  we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  always  you have a pledge  we will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  and  nasa is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world  and  when i took over three and a half years ago  there was grass growing in the runways  you know that it was closed down  it was a mess  we are now the hottest in the world  you see what's going up  and  we've got a lot of rich guys sending them up too  i liked that better  i said  ""let them do it "" rich guys like rockets  i don't know  they like rocket  boom  i see dollars going right up  but they need a good place to launch  we have the best places  we have the best places  so it's been incredible what we've done with nasa  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools  we're already there again  we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  and  we will live by the timeless works of our national motto  in god we trust  for years  you had a president who apologized for america  now  you have a president who is standing up for america  and standing up for the

21,15,Aug,2019,datasets/NewHampshire,"thank you very much everybody  thank you  wow  i will never  ever let you down  that i can tell you  amazing  and i want to thank manchester and new hampshire  they're very special  you remember those primaries  that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary  trump should come in third or fourth  and we came in easily number one  and that was the beginning  that was an easy one  i want to thank you all  this is incredible and it's great to be back in a state that i love with thousands of hardworking patriots  who are the heart and soul of america  and that's what you are  we're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of new hampshire in 2020  and i saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media  and it said that i'm tied with three of the other candidates  the democrats  i'm tied in new hampshire  i don't think so  one of them has a rally  he's got 100 people  so this holds 12 000 we're full  and we could fill it up four times at least  we could fill it up four times  but i just want to thank you all  i just think it's going to be a tremendous four years  we're going to have a tremendous four years  can you believe it  we only have a little more than a year to go  where it all started  right  the greatest political movement in the history of our country  and even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through  we have taken this big beautiful ship  and it's being turned around very quickly  three years ago  we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make america great again  and that's exactly what we've done  i think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in america  make america great again  so if you don't mind  the other candidates go  they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that i'm going to ask you  they spend millions  you remember the first slogan from our opponent  that's right  neither do i  neither does anybody  nobody remembers  the only thing i remember is the first night i went out after i heard it and i said  see  it's all about her  and they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars  it's all about her  that didn't work out too well  that slogan wasn't too good  so we have to do this  we have to make a decision  do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country  make america great again  right  do we give up make america great again for a new slogan  because look  our country is doing great  we are doing very well with china despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary  all you have to do is say china  how you doing  they're not too happy  they're not too happy  they're losing millions of jobs  the tariffs are working  and they're eating the tariffs by the way  there's no price increase  you know  you gotta talk to these people  the fake news  but do we give up  and by the way  the biggest beneficiary  you know who have been great  our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by china  and frankly they've been targeted for a long time  including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time  so we're making up for a lot of lost ground  but do we give up make america great for keep america great  keep america great  okay  you ready  ready  i love this because it's free  and we have all the time in the world  right  is there anything better than a trump rally  what about a sleepy joe biden rally  well  he's made some beauties  i sort of hope it's him  i don't mind any of them  you got pocahontas is rising  we got kamala  kamala is falling  you got beto  beto is like gone  all right  we'll see what happens  whoever it is  i don't know that it matters  but whoever it is different  different people  but i don't know  i think sleepy joe may be able to limp across the finish line  but today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster  they're going to have fewer appearances  you've heard that  right  they're going to cut way back on his appearances  can you believe it  if i ever did that  it would be over  the fake news would get us  but we don't let them get us and it is fake  and today the deputy editor of the new york times was demoted  isn't that beautiful  all the news that is not fit to print  all the news  the fake failing new york times  it's really we  it's not me  we're doing it together  they came from the hills  they came from the mountains  from the rivers  they came from all over the place  and they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before  and it was 306 to 223  remember  306  and we won wisconsin and they said  ""oh  we never thought of that "" got to think about those things  and we won michigan  and now we have a lot of car companies coming into michigan  and we have a lot of great farming events happening  really big in wisconsin  and we have incredible things going on in pennsylvania  we just opened up a  10 billion plant  we have many of them going up  many of them  a lot of jobs  in louisiana  an lng plant  10 billion  could never have happened  could never have happened  pennsylvania would have never happened  they wouldn't have allowed him to frack  so they would've never been able to build it  but what a place that is  it will be open in a little more than a year  but i have to make a decision  it's a big decision  do we give up the greatest theme  phrase  logo  whatever you want to call it  in the history of politics  risky  for a brand new one because make america great again  we're really sort of there  and we have a little time left  and now we have a group of socialists or communists  could be  they're not far away  the fake news will hit me on that  how dare he say that  but they're not far away  right  they're not far away  95%  does anybody want to pay 95% taxes  i don't think so  but i'm not going to go into their plan because as far as i'm concerned  the green new deal is a beautiful thing  no  it's a beautiful thing  we want it to continue onward until about a month before the election  i will let them have it like you've never heard before  i don't want it to change  too early  it's like elizabeth warren  i did the pocahontas thing  i hit her really hard  and it looked like she was down and out  but that was too long ago  i should've waited  but don't worry  we will revive it  it can be revived  it can be rewritten  right  it will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly  and we're going to have some fun in the state of new hampshire  now what do we do  ready  let me have first make america great again  then keep america great  right  just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign  and there's a possibility we'll use both  there's a possibility we'll use both 'cause i hate like hell to give up the one  is it a possibility we'll use both  maybe one a little bit less  are you ready  so we'll start make america great again  and then keep america  are you ready  who's in favor of the campaign theme being make america great again  who's in favor of our theme being keep america great  oh  wait a minute  this is your hat  i was going to keep it actually  thank you  so that's really been the reaction  i've done this before  big crowds  and it really is keep america great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us  they want to take it away  because until a couple of days ago  and that'll catch up very quickly  we have no choice  by the way  i never said china was going to be easy  but it's not tough and they want to make a deal  we just spoke to them yesterday  they want to make a deal  they want to make a deal  they have to make a deal  and you know what  it'd be wonderful to make a deal  i don't think we're ready to make a deal  we're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs  and again  china's devaluing their currency  they're pouring out money  the prices haven't gone up  so that means we're taking in billions of dollars  we're not paying for it  and ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly  they want to make a deal  and they should want to make a deal  but when you listen to the fake news  look at how many there are  i mean  i actually had something today  i had something today  are we sure that we're in new hampshire  you know  you have a reputation  i mean  i know it's not true 'cause i know you too well  you have a reputation of being very stayed  very  very elegant  stayed  incredible people  you're not acting it tonight  and that's good  that's a good thing  wow  we love our country  we have enthusiasm for our country  that's what it is  before the election  our factories were closing  hey  who knows it better than you  you're like central casting for the closing of factories  our jobs were vanishing  our military was totally depleted  when i took over  our military was sad  we weren't flying half of our planes  they were old  they were tired  our equipment was tired  our people weren't tired  though  our people weren't tired  but everything we had  it was depleted  now we've rebuilt our military like never before  and all made in the usa  just so you know  and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad  they don't disrespect us anymore  folks  i got nato to pay an extra hundred billion dollars  they weren't paying  they were delinquent  many nations were  except for seven  many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying  so we're supposed to protect them  they kill us on trade  they have all sorts of barriers and everything else  the taxes are really unfair  the tariffs were ridiculous  what they do to us in europe  and then we protect them  then they don't pay  and i say  ""i'm sorry folks  you have to pay  you have to pay "" they were delinquent  they were delinquent  and my biggest fan is secretary general stoltenberg from nato  he said until president trump came along  we were going  boom  they would've been finished very quickly  but i'm tired of paying for other nations anyway  i have to be honest with you  today  our nation is stronger than ever before  we're now stronger than ever before  you saw we ended the iran disaster  how about that  we paid them a  150 billion   1 8 billion in cash  cash  cash  cash  we got nothing  and they also want to make a deal  china wants to make a deal  and i will tell you iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them  they are not happy  so we'll see how it all turns out  but it's in good hands  it's in good hands  the united states right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world  we're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about  our united states armed forces  america is working again  america is winning again  and america is respected again  respected like never before  they respect us again  and you see it  you know  a recent poll came out where it showed that president obama was more popular in germany and other places than i am  and i said  of course he's more popular  he's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide  he's not doing that  i'm doing that  and in fact  if i was the most popular  i'm not doing my job right  so true  we've created over six million new jobs since the election  if i would have said that during the campaign  those people back there would have been headlines  headlines  more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps  since my election  the number of new businesses starting in the great state of new hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25%  and you can't really go by my election  you gotta go by november 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since november 9th  that's the day after i won the election  so i won the election  the markets went up thousands of points  things started happening  you started doing things that you would've never  even though i didn't get sworn in until january 20th  but they refused to do that  and let me tell you  if for some reason i wouldn't have won the election  these markets would have crashed  that'll happen even more so in 2020  see the bottom line is i know you like me and this room is a love fest  i know that  but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes  everything's going to be down the tubes  so whether you love me or hate me  you got to vote for me  i had a businessman the other day  one of the most successful guys in the country  i've never liked him  never liked him  he never liked me  i never liked him  i see him in the white house  i said  ""what are you doing here "" he said  i'm working to make sure you get elected "" i said  ""you've got to be kidding  you don't like me  i don't like you  what the hell is this all about "" he said  ""that's right  we've had our differences  i haven't liked you  but to be honest with you  mr  president  i have no choice "" i said  ""you're right  you're right "" first thing i've ever heard him say that i agreed with  he's got no choice  he got no choice  unemployment in new hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years  but within a very short period of time  it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country  think of that  you have the best unemployment  you have the most successful state in the history of your state  and in the history of our country  and then you're going to vote for somebody else  oh  great  let's vote for elizabeth pocahontas warren  we have the best numbers we've ever had  let's vote for somebody else  i don't think that's going to happen  folks  i don't think that's going to happen  only with fixed poles does that happen  unemployment for african americans  you've heard me say this many times  and i'm very proud of it  hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county  wages are rising quickly  remember when i used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago  i used to say it all the time  now i can say for the first time in 20 years  wages are rising  and you know who's the biggest beneficiary  blue collar workers  my administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race  religion  color  and creed  very important  because we are all americans  we all share the same home  we all share the same heart  we all share the same dreams  we are all children of the same almighty god  but at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings  the radical democrats are trying to tear america apart  they vilify anyone who doesn't share their extreme views  they slander our law enforcement heroes  you see what they're doing with our police that we love  you see what they're doing  has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on new york's finest  have you ever seen  and i know a lot of new york's finest  they're not happy  they're not happy  and they are great people  these are great  great  proud people  for that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace  they view everybody as fascist and nazis  they used the term nazi  this was a term  you couldn't even use it  now they use it like on a regular basis  nazi  he's a nazi  think of that  he's a nazi  you couldn't use it  now they use it  they accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps  and they do an incredible job  and the democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum  they do an incredible job  our border agents  and they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run  but while the democrats rage and resist 窶ｦ that guy's got a serious weight problem  go home  start exercising  get him out of here please  you got a bigger problem than i do  got a bigger problem than all of us  now he goes home and his mom says  ""what the hell have you just done "" we are continuing our incredible movement  the greatest political movement in the history of our country  there's never been a movement like this  never  our movement is built on love  and it is  and we love our family  we love our faith  we love our flag  and we love our freedom  and that's what it's about  and add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our- 窶ｦ the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country  together we are all united by one fundamental principal  a nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens  it's own  we've got to take care of our own  you haven't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time  it's called america first  it's america first  we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous republican leaders and great friends of mine  a man who's doing an incredible job as your governor  because i want to take 100% of the credit for the incredible turnaround of new hampshire  and i remember it not so long ago  things were not looking good  people were leaving  a lot of bad things were happening  but we have to give him a lot of credit  he's been a great governor  chris sununu  with a great father too  great father  with a great father窶ｦ his father was tough  chris  your father was so tough  he was for somebody else in the primaries  and then one by one窶ｦ i won here  i won there  i won there  and then when i won his father got on and i said  ""oh  this guy kills me  he's so tough "" and he said  ""president trump will be the greatest of all time  i said  ""what happened  what happened "" he went from being the toughest critic to the best there is  so i want to say hello to your father  okay chris  you'll tell him  great guy  what a family  what a family  thank you for chris  new hampshire senate republican leader  chuck morse  chuck  thanks  chuck  new hampshire house republican leader  dick hinch  thank you  dick  thank you  dick  great job  a man who was with me right from the beginning  in fact  he had a meeting at his house  his house has never been the same  his house is a disaster now  like somebody said he just sold it  but you know what  because of the trump economy  i'll bet he sold it for a big  big  fat  beautiful profit  where is steve  steve stepanek and his wife  who's incredible  did you make a lot of money on the house  we destroyed the house  this was the beginning  he held some kind of a meeting for me  and he has a nice house  but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house  it's never been the same  no wonder you sold it  they finally gave up  and that was four years ago  anyway  thank you very much both for being here  i appreciate it  what great people  thank you  steve  great job  and i hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that little窶ｦ steve  i hope the buyer didn't hear what i just said about your house  he'll cancel窶ｦ that's all right  you'll sell it for more to somebody else  don't worry  republican party chair  ronna mcdaniel  you know  ronna headed up michigan  and for many  many years nobody won michigan as a republican  but i used to complain  i'd go there and i'd say ""they're stealing your car business "" i'd go for years  in fact  five or six years before i even thought about running  for whatever reason  they named me man of the year in michigan  i said  ""how come "" i didn't even understand it myself  but i was named man of the year  i wasn't even political  that was years before i did this  but i was always complaining that our car business is being stolen  i mean  it's sort of obvious  right  mexico now has 32% of our car business  it all left the state of michigan  we are bringing it back at a level that nobody's ever seen before  our car business  but i went to michigan and my opponent was told that the republicans  no way you can win michigan  or wisconsin  that you just can't  and we had a campaign manager named ronna mcdaniel  and ronna wouldn't stop  ""sir  can you be here next week "" i say  ""i don't know "" then i leave and she said  ""sir  can you come back in three days "" i said  ""i don't know "" then i do it and she said  ""how about another time "" and then on election night she said  ""sir "" it was six o'clock the day before the election  in other words  just a short while before the election  she calls me  ""sir  can you be here tonight "" i said ""tonight "" and by the way  you know where i was  i was in new hampshire  that's right  she said  ""sir  can you be here tonight "" i said  ""are you sure "" i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning  now it's election day  we had 32 000 people show up  it was like this  the crowd was just  they want to see things happen in our country  they love our country  it went crazy  i left and i said  ""i don't know why going to lose michigan  why would we lose michigan  look at this "" the opponent went there with barack obama and michelle obama and she went there much earlier  prime time  one o'clock  two o'clock in the morning is not exactly prime time  we had 32 000 and they had a tiny little crowd  and i looked at my people and i said  ""i know we're not supposed to win the great state of michigan  but i think we're going to win michigan"" and we won michigan and we won wisconsin  we won wisconsin  wisconsin was a great victory  and we won pennsylvania  and we won north carolina and south carolina  and we won florida  and i hate to tell you we should've won new hampshire  that was taken away  new hampshire was taken away  it was taken away from us  but we should've  we did great in new hampshire  we should've won new hampshire  but that's okay  i'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault  but we had a woman in michigan and i said  ""when it came time to choosing the head of the republican national committee "" i said  ""who the hell is that woman up in michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can't continue to lose our car business "" we have 17 companies now coming back in  ""who is that woman "" and it was ronna  we put her in charge of the republican national committee  the job that she has done is incredible  thank you  the same with another man  our campaign manager  he started off as a computer genius  and remember when they used to say that the hillary clinton campaign is highly sophisticated  highly窶ｦ she did a lot of bad things folks  33 000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the united states congress  33 000  remember she said it was about her daughter's wedding and yoga classes  33 000  yes  it was disgraceful  i will tell you this  we now have a great attorney general  a fair guy  a great gentleman  another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager  he is an unbelievable talent  but they were saying about our opponents窶ｦ i'm not going to mention the name again because we'll never get it finished here  so i'll just say my opponent  is that better  they were saying how sophisticated her campaign was  except ours was far more sophisticated  and we had a man that did an incredible job  he's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings i've ever seen  his name is brad parscale and he is fantastic  it's nice when you don't have to look for anybody  you just look over and you see a guy who's twice as tall as everyone  great job  brad  thank you  how we doing  brad  good  doing good  got great poll numbers  we've got great poll numbers in a lot of states  ohio  iowa  you know iowa  every week that they campaign our numbers go up  they're winning iowa  we gave them ethanol  which is very important  a lot of things for iowa  but every week we seem to be going up in iowa because they're campaigning in iowa  wherever they go  our numbers go up  somebody's going to have to explain that one to me someday  but we like it  a man who's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of new york city  stand up  rudy  stand up  rudy  rudy giuliani  man  he did a job in the first year  i've never seen anything like it  new york was crime infested  we had problems  we had problems like nobody would believe  rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it  it wasn't like  ""oh gee  he's a horrible person "" people loved rudy giuliani  he was a great  great mayor  so thank you  rudy  for being here  the first person that i put on on the campaign  he was driving me wild  he said  ""i'm saying you can win  sir  you can win  i'm telling you  you can win "" he loves this state  he's from this state  he said  ""you can win  sir  i'm just telling you "" i had him on for month after month  he'd come drive me crazy  he'd say  ""you can win  you can win  you can win "" and finally we said  ""let's give it a shot "" and i had corey  i had hope  i had just a couple of people  we had a rather lean and mean staff  but corey lewandowski loves your state  loves new hampshire  he was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame  he's tough and he's smart and i'm hearing he's thinking about running for the senate from new hampshire  there we go  i think he'd be tough to beat  i'll tell you one thing  he'll go into washington and he's going to have you in mind  he's going to do a job if he does do it  so we'll see what happens  he hasn't made up his mind yet  but he would be fantastic  i guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family  you talk to your wife and you make a decision  they're all saying  ""are you going to support him "" i said  ""i don't know if he's running "" so corey  let us know please  if you don't mind  let us know  our shared republican agenda is pro worker  pro jobs  pro family  pro growth  and 100% pro american  for decades and decades the permanent politicians in washington pursued the very opposite  they sold out our workers  you see it  you know it better than any place  when i talk about the horrors of nafta  the horrors of trade deals窶ｦ i mean  i'm sorry to tell you this  i usually refer to new hampshire  nobody took it worse than new england and nobody took it worse than new hampshire  now  here's the good news  i would never let that happen again and chris will never let that happen again  is there a doctor  please  doctor in the house  thank you  doctor in the house  please  doctor  please  thank you very much  take your time  yeah  take your time  thank you  take your time  fellas  plenty of time  you know  people got here two and a half days ago  many of these people in the front  right  two and a half days ago  a lot of these people  so you can understand  it's pretty tough  thank you  thank you  that's okay  these are great people  these are great people that love our country  just remember that  thank you very much  thank you  thank you very much  pretty good  pretty good  so our politicians shipped away our jobs  shed our sovereignty  surrendered our dignity  and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another  and we're still here  he just said it  we're still here  you better believe it  and we're here stronger than ever before we're here  but all of that ended the day that i took the oath of office  the american people are in charge of their country again  we cut a record number of job-killing regulations that were strangling our country  we cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms  four years  eight years  or in one case more than that  cut more than anybody  to get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country  you're making a lot more money  you're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week  we ended the last administration's cruel war on american energy and we are delivering a policy of american energy independence like you've never seen before  in fact  if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems  you look at the straits  number one  they're not touching our ships  they're not playing with our ships  they're taking them from this country  from that country  from that country  but you know what  very importantly  we have very few ships going there anymore because we don't need that oil and gas  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  every leading democrat has pledged abolish the american oil  coal  and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom  can you imagine this  we're sitting on great wealth  they want to take it away from us  and the alternatives don't have the power  they don't have the power  they want wind  wind  wind is oh so beautiful  as long as you don't have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing  steve  if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would've gotten one third of the price you got  steve  that's true  by the way  steve's too smart to let that happen  we won't let them take it away from you  we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered new hampshire and your factories  they shattered your communities and they shattered american power and american prestige all around the globe  new hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following nafta and china's entrance into the organization  two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world  not just our country  election after election  politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the american worker  then they went to washington and let other countries push them around  and special interests  buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies  that's what happened  me  i don't care about their campaign contributions  it doesn't matter to me  folks  we want to do a job  we want to do a great job  and we're setting records  and you know who's sending us the money  the small donors  well  we have big donors  but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election  pretty amazing  that's not supposed to happen to a republican  but it's happening to this republican and it's happening to you  every vow that politicians made was broken  every hope was dashed  and every promise turned into a total betrayal of new hampshire and of our country  but in this administration  we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of  it's called strength and commitment  we don't play games  we don't play games  after years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country  standing up for our jobs  our workers  and standing up for our dignity  the forgotten men and women of america will never ever be forgotten again  you were forgotten  the last administration with sleepy joe and obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated  worse than nafta  worse than wto  it was called the trans-pacific partnership  it would have been a disaster  tpp would have gutted the american auto industry  it would have been in shambles  our auto industry is coming back so strong  it would've gutted  would've destroyed the industry  but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew the united states from that job-destroying catastrophe  we're imposing beautiful well-placed tariffs  money comes in  on foreign countries that cheat our workers  steal our jobs  and break all the rules  i'm sorry  and by the way  they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years  we have countries that charge us 100%  200%  297% in the case of canada with your farm products  we're not going to stand for it  and man  did we turn things around and we've just started  if companies don't want to pay a tariff  i have one simple solution  come make your product in america  come make your product in new hampshire  zero tariffs  zero  no tariff  together we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with american iron  american aluminum  and american steel  we're doing it steel  steel industry is high  they were dumping steel all over  they were destroying our companies  us steel now  all of them  they're all expanding  the steel industry is back  it's doing great  we're opening up mines in minnesota  the great state of minnesota  they have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and president obama closed them down  maybe we can get representative omar from minnesota to open it up  but i don't think so  she'll open them up  i don't think so  representative omar  that's another one  we're replacing nafta with the brand new usmca  that's mexico and canada  great deal  the usmca will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state  we need congress to pass the usmca immediately  we'll make it a bipartisan deal  we don't even want credit  the unions benefit  the non-unions benefit  everybody benefits  it brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries  go to mexico or canada  we lose all our jobs  we lose all our taxes  we end up with empty factories and plants  it makes it almost impossible  we're not going to have that  that was my one rule that i had to have  it's going to be very  very hard for companies to do that  i've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china's chronic trade abuses  earlier this month  the us government officially labeled china for the first time ever a currency manipulator  another promise kept  while others allowed china to freely loot the us economy   500 billion a year  not million  not million  billion with a b  we've made it clear that the theft of american jobs and american wealth is over  yet today  the wall street journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business  nothing  they advocate only economic surrender  they actually say  ""go to china  take off the tariffs  make a deal "" i lose all the cards we take off the tariffs  we don't have any cards  think of it  they say ""go to europe ""  by the way  the european union is worse than china  just smaller  it treats us horribly  barriers  tariffs  taxes  and we let them come in  it's worse than china  many of us come from there  i do  that's what it's got going  that's about it  they treat us really badly  and many others  many  many others  india tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world  we have tariffs of 100% on products and much more than that  india  so we're working on all of them  i called prime minister modi  i said  ""mr  prime minister  it's not fair  we've got to change  we've got to change  we've got to change "" and we're talking to them very seriously  we're talking to a lot of places  but when the wall street journal comes out and they say  "" no  no  take the tariffs  go and talk to china "" they've been trying to talk to them for 25 years  but actually  you know what  they really haven't  the fact is the leaders that were in my position  they didn't do a damn thing  they didn't talk  they didn't talk  past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business  i guess  and our industries were utterly decimated  globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense  globalism  i love our country  i'm the president of the united states of america  i'm not the president of the the world  as long as i'm president  america will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years  as we restore our prosperity  we are also restoring public safety  we are fighting to reduce violent crime  you see so much  and over the last 25 years so much crime  and ensure that every american can live in safety and peace  and yet with all that you see  we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had  it wouldn't seem that way  but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw  the law enforcement  they do a great job  you've been reading about this a lot lately  we are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn't have guns  but people have to remember  however  that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with  it's not the gun that pulls the trigger  it's the person holding the gun  years ago  many cities and states  i remember it so well  closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons  they let those people out onto the street  you probably have your examples up here  i can tell you in new york they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets  and you see plenty of them today  even today  we're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need  we have to do it  and at the same time  we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of窶ｦ 窶ｦ mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won't have to worry so much about that  the big problem  we don't have those institutions anymore and people can't get proper care  they're seriously ill people and they're on the streets  we can't make it harder for good  solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves  we will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment  we will  so important  one of the most powerful promises i made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic  i used to go around new hampshire more than any state and you'd say  ""sir  the state is infested "" you said  ""sir  we'll like a drug den "" you tell me  and i didn't really see it  and then i met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do  and you just seem to have a bigger problem  and by the way  the wall is being built  that's- that's going to stop a lot of it  the wall is being built  build the wall  build the wall  build the wall  build the wall  build the wall  build the wall  build the wall  it's being built  you know  we have the fake news  you know about that  where they 窶ｦ a wall that's lying on the ground in a very important section  so we pick up the wall  it's in pieces  i mean literally it's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said  ""he didn't build a wall  that's just renovation  there was no wall  it's lying on the ground "" people walk right over and it's rotted  rusted  gone  we take it away  we put a brand new wall up  they give me no credit  you know why  because they're fake news  that's why  we're building a lot of walls  the army corps of engineers is doing a great job  they're doing a great job  since i took office  we've attacked the challenge with everything we have  we have secured a record  6 billion in new funding  opioid  we vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs  which are pretty amazing things  we've given them to your police department  your fire department  pretty amazing  we have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34%  the department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases  and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58% of all young americans  i said that you have to show them  we're doing ads beautiful ads  shows them  and you've seen them  i don't even want to describe them  they're brutal  but we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it  because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs  right  not get them started  it's hard to get off  you know  we can get them off and we're doing it and it's been done  but it's hard to get off  if they never start  it's real easy  it's real easy  so we're trying to get young kids  you won't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while  but we're really  we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids  children how bad drugs are  how dangerous they are  how horrible they are  how they destroy your brain  how they do so many bad things  and they're really very tough ads  they're hard hitting ads  and i think they're having a big impact  you'll see over time you'll see  over time you'll see  but we still have much work to do  but as a result of these efforts  last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years  that's pretty amazing  and at the center of america's drug crisis is the border crisis  vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth  cocaine  heroin and fentanyl  and as part of my trade deal with china  it's been very important  and president xi said he's going to do it  so far he has not done it  but i said  ""you have to stop sending us fentanyl "" have to  ""and you have to criminalize in china the making of fentanyl "" and so far he has not come through  but i think he will  you'll know  you'll know  yet democrats want to open borders and republicans want strong borders  that you're difference  one wants open borders  who can even think of an open border  think of it  even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people  they're are still coming in illegally  they're not coming in through merit  but what about the bad ones  we have serious  serious criminals that want to come in  and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you've never seen before  democrats want open borders  they don't mind crime  we do mind crime and that's the way it is  democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities  last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17 000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody  in other words  17 000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into us communities  you don't understand even what the hell are they doing  what are they doing  17 000  republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans  not for criminal aliens  we will always support the amazing heroes of ice and border patrol  and we will always support law enforcement  every democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare  republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy americans  not for illegal aliens  and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about  we need to elect a strong republican majority to end sanctuary cities  stop human traffickers  stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of american workers and families first  it's also time for democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter id  voter identification  it's incredible  they're constantly saying  ""oh  we need to protect them "" but they're not looking for that  they're not looking for that  we say  ""what about voter id  in other words  you have a picture  you have to go up  what about voter id "" that they don't want to do  but we need voter id  the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream  where do they come from  you know  you say you want low taxes  good education  strong military  strong borders  you want to have safe homes  you want a house  you want low interest rates  you've got low 窶ｦ hey  you got low interest rates  the lowest ever  got low rates  it's a good time to refinance your house  by the way  great time  you got everything  and then you see these people they're against 窶ｦ they have no idea what they're doing  they have no idea what they're against  every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of american families that they love  my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you  the individual mandate is gone  the most unpopular part of obamacare  and we almost have obamacare gone  we're close  we would have had it before  but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising  i'm sure none of you knew who that vote was  we had it done  repealed and replaced  but it's going to happen and i think it's going to actually be in the end  actually better  you watch  so we got rid of the individual mandate  which was the most unpopular part of obamacare  and we're running it better  you know  i had a political decision  do i make it great  alex azar our secretary  do rerun it well and sort of say  ""hey  we run it well "" or do we run it badly and have everybody upset  we said  we got to run it well  but it's still much too expensive  it's lousy healthcare  but we got rid of the worst part of it  individual mandate  individual mandate  where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance  that's no good health insurance  and we won't 窶ｦ and you got to remember this  republicans  and i speak for every one of them  we will always protect pre-existing conditions  we're going to protect  always  right  got to do it  our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years  the only decline in 51 years  we have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency  empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family  believe it or not  you didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs  who could even believe this  i wonder if big pharma had something to do with that  so we're going to have transparency  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mothers womb  right up  up till 窶ｦ right up until the moment of birth  and in the case of the virginia governor  he's having a rough  rough time  in his case  the baby is born  and then he goes to talk to the mother  the doctor talks to the mother  the baby is now born  wrapped as he said  and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby  who would believe that  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred  the gift of god  hard to believe isn't that  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion and socialism  the republican party is the party of freedom  we are the party of the american worker  the american family  and the american dream and i'm fighting for you each and every day  so importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges  within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges  thank you very much president obama  thank you very much  i don't know what happened to them  but i came to office and i had 138 judges that were not appointed by president obama  so i say  thank you mr  president  very good and they'll say he was a great president  oh  the fake news  he was a great president  if he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a president of the united states has to do  great president  he was great  he was a great president  and these judges will apply the law as written  including we appointed two great supreme court justices  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  and to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something i'm so proud of  44 years they couldn't get it passed  right to try  you can use our newest  our best medicines  incredible  what's happening  i'm so proud of that  and this from forever  five decades  we pass for our great veterans va choice and va accountability  and one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in new hampshire  i don't know where you are  where's our guy  where is he  so  al  so  i walk in i said  hello  he's been with me from the beginning  he wasn't with 窶ｦ he liked trump  and i came in  he said  sir  he's a great veteran  he said  ""sir  i have cancer  and sir  i went into the vet  they were very  very late  they had problems  i'm not blaming them  but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon "" he had his operation  you look much better than you did three years ago al  much better  much better  va choice  right al  va choice  great story  thank you very much  and thank you for your loyalty  he's been to every rally i ever gave a new hampshire right from the beginning  i got so tired of looking at him  he'd always be here  now he's 窶ｦ look at him  now he's sitting in very good  that's good  but i appreciate that story  i appreciate  va choice just makes sense  right  doesn't it make sense  we've achieved record funding for the united states military   716 billion   700 billion and  738 billion  and it's almost completely rebuilt  including  and we hope to god we never have do use it  we have the finest  most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth  and i hope to god we never have to use it  we're investing in the future of human space flight  and someday soon american astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of mars  i told my guys at nasa  you know  nasa  when we took it over  it was exhausted  the runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete  you wouldn't recognize it now  it's beautiful  it's the best place anywhere on earth  and i also said  though  you know  i hear all these rich guys for some reason  they love space  so they're rich  i said  let them send the rockets up  what the hell do we have to do it  right  so i see jeff bezos and elon musk  they're putting rockets up  i think it's great  and they pay us rent  they use our facility  that's great  but we're also doing it  and nasa has some of the greatest plans we've ever had  these are great people  great scientists  but we also let the private sector put up rockets  the one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming 窶ｦ there's no wings  no nothing  it's almost like  what are we watching is this fiction  and they come down and they save all of the propellants  all of the  really the most expensive parts  they're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off  who would think they could do this  i never saw this before six months ago  but they're doing it now more and more  they're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets  so we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent  but we're also doing it ourselves  to protect america's security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and just three months ago  we also recognized the golan heights as being a part of and protected by israel  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new hampshire  thank you  and you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner  2020 right around the corner  and it's about one thing  you know what the one thing is  you  it's about you  it's about your family  it's about your future  and it's about the fate of your country  so when we ran together last time  we said the most importantly we had to turn it around  this country was going bad  you see what happened to venezuela with socialism  venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries  now they don't have water  they don't have food  they don't have anything  and this was one of the richest nations in the world  they don't have anything  we're working on it  we're helping people  but it's very sad  it's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation  ever  no matter what label they use  a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction 窶ｦ the destruction of the american dream  we have a dream  it's a great dream  this the destruction of the american dream  we begin this campaign tonight with the best record  the best results  the best agenda  and the only positive vision for the people of new hampshire and for the people of america  together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  millions and millions of people  with your help  we will elect a republican congress to create a safe  modern  fair and lawful system of immigration  we will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  ending the aids epidemic in america and finding new cures for childhood cancer  something i never thought i'd be able to say  within one decade the aids epidemic in the united states will be gone  think of that  did you ever think you were going to hear that  no  did you ever think you were going to hear that  the work they've done on aids is incredible  that's an incredible thing  when they told me that  it's just shattering  it just  it breaks your heart what's happened  but think of it in 10 years  the aids epidemic will be eradicated  so great  who thought that was going to be happening  who thought i'd be able to get to say that so early in what we're doing together  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together  there is one america we will support  protect and defend the constitution of

beautiful children  we are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers  pioneers and patriots  and we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest republic on the face of this earth  every day my presidency  we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us  the brave this beautiful  strong  proud  and free future

about flooring  they put in a floor that's like an ice skating rink  so we're going to tiptoe around  how are you  everybody  we love you  we love you  great  great people  manchester  we had some good memories in manchester  2016  but this is going to be  we are right now in the most important election in our history  but i'm thrilled to be back in the granite state with the true hard-working american patriots  last night it was my great honor to accept the republican nomination for president of the united states  we're going to win  we're going to win  does anybody have any doubt  does anybody窶ｦ it's very interesting  last night we had an incredible time and i don't know if you know  it's driving the fake news crazy  they're back  but the poll numbers have swung  if you go back six months before the plague flew in from china  the plague  the horrible plague  this election was over  this election was over  and then i had to go back to work  i had to go back to work  and then i went back to work and we've done an incredible job in every aspect of running government  but i also had to start campaigning a little bit again  and i did  and today it was announced that joe biden is coming out of the basement  because the poll numbers have totally swung  they totally swung  and they've swung like nobody's ever seen them swing before  and it was rapid  it was a rapid swing  because they all admit that we're doing a great job  there's not too many presidents that have done a job like we've done  including keeping you out of wars  bringing you home from the endless wars  but they've swung  but here's what i don't get  sleepy joe's coming out he said in 10 days  that's a long窶ｦ 10 days  10 days  that's like an eternity in trumpville  10 days  i view 10 days is like an

 i think he's  i think he just窶ｦ and how about those stories from friends of mine  how about those stories  was that just compelling and incredible television  but really that was an exciting  a

herschel walker  when you watch that that was from the heart  that was from the heart  dana white today  i just saw it today because last night i was looking at this speech a little bit  we had a wonderful turnout last night  what i didn't like  you saw this right  when it was over  you saw when it was over  the thugs outside because the democratic mayor of washington dc  it's another democrat that's not believing in law and order  and you know we give washington dc a lot of money to run it  but they don't do a good job of running it  the mayor  she doesn't run anything  and these incredible people from all over the country  all over the world that were there last night  they walked out to a bunch of thugs  and that wasn't  remember this  that wasn't friendly protesters  they were thugs  they were thugs  and the dc police are good  but the mayor gave bad instructions last night  that should have never been allowed to happen  when a senator like rand paul walks out  and thank god we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous窶ｦ they took tremendous abuse  and rand paul was in big trouble last night  he's a good guy  he's a friend of mine  and that shouldn't happen to anybody  but he is a us senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the white house and we ought to give them a medal of some kind  and we're going to do it  we're going to do it  i told that to rand  and the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that's what's happening in portland  and that's what's happening all over where you have democrat-run cities  just take a look  and we're looking at the whole situation in dc  and tonight they have a lot of people gathering  let's see how that works out  they have to be able to manage their affairs  they get a lot of money  she's always looking for money  ""could we have more money "" ""what are you going to waste it on  i mean spend it on  what are you going to waste it on  mayor "" and then our people walk out  and these are people from all over the world  they walk  including congress  by the way  they walk out and they get accosted  they get abused  they get spit on  it's a disgrace  and our country is going to change  we're not going to allow that to happen  you know  we're not supposed to be窶ｦ we're not supposed to be involved unless we're invited in by the people that run  these are all democrat cities  just so you understand  including dc  so we're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection  but that's a big statement  it's a big statement  no reason for it  but you know what we're going to do  we're going to have to look at it  mark meadows is here  we're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the white house to celebrate our country  and a weak guy named joe biden  and he's weak  he's weak as hell  a weak guy like joe biden didn't even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire democrat national convention  now they're all of a sudden窶ｦ now they realize because they've gone down like a rock in water  they've gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they're talking all  ""well  we have to talk about crime "" number one  they have no窶ｦ look at what happened to new york  look at what's going on in chicago  all democrats  all radical left democrats  look at what's going on in the great state of wisconsin  now i will tell you  two days ago we sent in the national guard  that was the end of that problem  look at portland  we want to send in the national guard  we sent in homeland security just to protect our窶ｦ couple of our buildings  including a courthouse  can you believe it  we sent in because- 窶ｦ couple of our buildings  including a courthouse  can you believe it  we send in because they can't protect it  so we sent  they did a very effective job  we could take care of portland in 45 minutes  45 minutes  if that governor  if that mayor would call and say  ""please send in the national guard "" just like 窶ｦ hey  we did it in minneapolis  remember that  the place was going to burn down  another few days  we send in the national guard  it was over within an hour  they ought to get smart and that's what they ought to do  so now they're talking about  ""well  we want to 窶ｦ"" why did they call it a friendly protest  right  remember the idiot from cnn  he's standing there  this is a friendly protest  behind him over his shoulders  the entire city is burning down  sixty seven days from now  we're going to win the great state of new hampshire  we have to  we're going to win four more years in the white house  within my first term in office  we've secured america's borders  brought back our manufacturing jobs  rebuilt the united states military  it was a mess  it was a depleted mess  wiped out the isis caliphate  killed our terrorists enemies  kept america out of foolish  stupid  ridiculous foreign wars  achieved american energy independence  you see the price of your gasoline  when you go fill it up  ""oh boy  that's a nice price "" it's half what it was  we built the single greatest economy in the history of the world  that includes china  which was having a very  very bad year  then the plague came in from china  we had to close it up  we saved millions of lives and now we're open again and we're setting records  we're setting records  wait till you see the numbers just before the election  there'll be released and this is despite the fact that the democrats are holding back michigan  north carolina  you take a look  pennsylvania  they want to keep them  by the way  on november 4th  regardless  they'll be opening them up  november 4th  because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me  but our numbers are going to be great  we're going to have a great third quarter  we're going to have an unbelievable next year  unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes  this november  each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country  i used to say it about 2016  this is now at a new level  joe biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment  which will have no chance  your vote will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow biden to eliminate your jobs  by the way  it's not biden  it's not biden  it's his masters  his 窶ｦ they tell him what to do  his masters  they want to erase your borders  confiscate your guns  appoint radical left judges and prosecutors  tear down our history  demolish your suburbs  you saw what i did  i ended the rule  you're not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore  but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn't want to write that  but everyone knows  unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be  they know that  they want to destroy your suburbs  indoctrinate our children  defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like portland  oregon than what we're used to looking at  never forget  they are coming after me because i am fighting for you  it's true  today's democrat party is filled with hate  just look at joe biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage  right  you see it  it's crazy  it's crazy  you ought to see last night in washington  it was a disgrace  it was a disgrace that these people are representing the united states of america  it was a disgrace  protesters  you know what i say  protest is your ass  i don't talk about my ass  they're not protestors  those aren't 窶ｦ those are anarchists  they're agitators  they're rioters  they're looters  they're not 窶ｦ you know you say that and some of the people  not all of them  but some of the people back there  ""oh  how dare you  these are friendly protesters  right "" friendly 窶ｦ they're just looking for trouble  has nothing to do with george floyd  has nothing to do with anything  they don't even know who george floyd is  okay  they don't know who george floyd  they have no idea  if you ask them  ""who's george floyd "" they couldn't even tell you  these are just bad people  troublemakers and they shouldn't be representing our country at important events and we've got to stop it  democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals  marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations  but they don't believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together  you can't go to church anymore  you know how many churches are closed in this country because of the democrats  you can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets  threatening other people  beyond threatening  kicking them in the face  doing what they've done  you've seen it  they would have done that to senator rand paul last night  he'd either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn't happen to be there  they took some big beating  the reason they didn't fight back too much  they don't want to lose their pension  they don't want to lose their job  because we've become so politically correct  everybody's afraid to do anything now  but they did a good job  the puppet biden  who's just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings  funerals and school  but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets  mugging people  hurting people  robbing stores  looting stores  burning down storefronts  the radical left will do anything to get power  they smear justice  brett kavanaugh  and they are 窶ｦ did you see anything like that  justice kavanaugh  people forget  time goes by  they forget  we don't forget  i don't forget  they're destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if biden wins  which i honestly can't believe can happen  i will have lost to a low iq individual  i don't want that  i don't want it  sleepy joe  i don't want it  but the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government  can you believe it  the levers  they call it the levers of government  the top 10 most dangerous cities in america are run by democrats and have been for decades  now they're trying to impose those policies across the entire country  no one will be safe in biden's america  i can't even call it biden's america  god doesn't know he's alive  he's going to be out in 10 days  he's going to start 10 days  ten days  i mean  i gave a big speech last night  i said  ""what am i doing tomorrow night "" you're going to new hampshire  but sir  we can cancel new hampshire because you had a big night  we can cancel  are you crazy  i don't have the courage to cancel new hampshire  i got to win new hampshire  i love the people and you've been very good to me  you've been very good to me  you've been very good to me  so  new hampshire was the first state i won  right  remember  i came here  i was very excited  that was an exciting evening  that was an exciting race  but we don't talk about that anymore  we have to talk about the future  we don't talk about it  that was great  it was important  we've done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country  that's despite phony witch hunts  phony investigations  a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect  that's despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by china  who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world  because china does not want to see me win i can tell you that  we're not happy with china  i'll tell you why  if biden got in  china would own the united states very quickly  they'd own it  if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchist  criminals  rioters  looters  and flag burners  that's up to them  the republican party and you  i can see you  is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the american flag  is there anybody  please quietly raise your hand  be careful  could be very dangerous  the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and our law enforcement  right  we are all that stand between the american people and the left wing mob  if you want to save democracy from the mob  then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate  look  i believe i have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the democratic party  the worst  how do you get worse  i believe he's the worst candidate  the slowest candidate  i mean  in prime time  he was the slowest candidate  which was a long time ago  primetime  you know what i don't like though  they say he's like 78  79  78  i guess  right  i know people that are 85  that are 88  92  bernie marcus

came in  before that china virus came in  we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country  we had almost 160 million americans working  we had never had numbers like that  the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln  remember that  we- we stand for so much  including martin luther king's dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin  but by the content of their character  you know that  the radical left's effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart  there's so much racial hatred  and it's put there by cnn  by msdnc窶ｦ they stoke the flames and they know it  the good news is the ratings aren't great  so that's okay  they don't have great ratings  but they stoke the flames  uh-oh  cnn just turned off their camera again  they always turn off their camera  why do i keep doing that  every time i do it  they turn off their camera  they did it last time  i mention cnn  they're screaming  turn the camera off  our movement is about a brighter future for all americans of every race  religion  color  and creed  joe biden spent the last 47 years betraying the african american community  i've spent the last four years delivering for the african american community like nobody  with the exception possibly of abraham lincoln  has delivered before  it's true  my first week in office  i withdrew the united states from the last administration's horrible  stupid  insane trans pacific partnership  would've destroyed the us auto industry and many other industries  new hampshire lost one in four  and i think much more than that  manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto  it was more than one in four  that statistic is wrong  please have it changed  the statistic is wrong  far more than one in four  earlier this year  i kept my promise and replaced the nafta nightmare with a brand new us-mexico-canada agreement  they said that couldn't be done  i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging and plundering of american jobs  joe biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in america  after years of building up other nations  we are finally building up our nation and our jobs  and we're taking care of our people  last night  i got great reviews of the speech and all  but some of the fakers back there  they said  ""well  it was a

that  ""he didn't have the same energy in the speech that he usually has "" well  it's a different kind of a speech  tonight  i'm in new hampshire and we can wing it  see  actually  actually chris  who has always wanted to be his father  but it never worked out because of a lack of talent  actually though  actually chris has it wrong  if i did last night's speech here  by now you would have all been walking out  and if i did tonight's speech there  i would have been criticized by being slightly radical  but we're having a good time doing it this way  right  because we are finally putting america first  under my administration  america's borders are more secure than ever before  we ended the catch and release  stopped asylum fraud  and we have deported 20 000 gang members and 500 000 criminal aliens  we've already built 300 miles of border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week  the wall will soon be completed  and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been  and by the way  mexico is paying for the wall  just in case you didn't know that  they don't know that  they're paying for the wall  you haven't noticed on the wall  everything was wall  wall  they didn't think i was going to get it done  because look  you have one major party controlling congress and they don't want to give me a wall  so they're going crazy  ""wall  the wall's not getting done "" then i get it done  get it from the military  get it from everything  i'm a developer  i know how to get money  it's one of those  developers understand  and now that the wall is almost complete  it'll be soon complete  and it's the wall that border security wanted so badly  this is the one  but now that it's built  you never hear about the wall  they don't talk about it anymore  they don't talk about it anymore  it's incredible  but the wall will soon be complete  we've invested  2 5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in nearly 75 years  the space force  and al  in honor of you  we have passed va choice and va accountability  al  that guy's been bugging me for years  al has been bugging me  what's in that hat  al  let

administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  a disaster   150 billion we paid iran for a basically short term deal  and we gave them窶ｦ what's more impressive  we also gave them  1 8 billion in cash  cash  many plane loads  you know what that took  many  many plane loads   1 8 billion  i said bad  that's when i realized how powerful a president is in the united states  when a president has the right  which by the way  i don't believe he did have that right  okay  when a president has the right to go into the banks and take out  1 8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts  that's power  that's power  i don't believe he had the right to do it  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel and opened the us embassy in jerusalem  i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east in 25 years  you saw that just last week  uae  highly respected  mohamed  highly respected  uae and israel  and now they're all going to be coming in  now they're all saying  ""how come you didn't tell us about this "" you'll have peace in the middle east  and yet we're moving our trips out  it's pretty amazing  actually  we'll get no credit for it  but that's all right  remember that kaitlan  cover that properly  kaitlan  we like kaitlan  together  we've spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of biden disasters  joe biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history  he supported nafta  china's entry  he's done so many things  this man  if you look at what he's done  we went into a deal  the korea  you know about the korea deal  hillary clinton's deal  along with biden  they promised 250 000 jobs  right  250 000 jobs  and they were right  except all those jobs went to south korea  they didn't come to us  00  the polls close  and they said  ""donald trump has won the state of texas "" simultaneously with the closing  i'm now running in texas against a man who's against oil  guns  and god  how do you win texas  i said this  you could bring george washington back as your presidential candidate  you could bring abraham lincoln  let's put him as the vice presidential candidate  run in texas and other states  you couldn't win  you couldn't win  now  they're not going to win  we're going to win this  and you're against the oil stuff too  because his whole thing on oil  no fracking  no this  no that  new england has the highest energy costs in the united states  and you know why  because governor cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of new york state so that oil and gas  of which we have plenty  can come  and do you know where you buy your energy from  russia  did you know that  you have ships  much of it from russia  because governor cuomo  new york won't allow a pipeline and they're desperate to have something happen in upper new york state  and those are great people  but they've been treated very badly  but they won't allow a pipeline  by not allowing a pipeline  we're trying to do it through essentially eminent domain  by not allowing a pipeline to go through upper new york state and create a lot of jobs for them  you have the highest energy prices in the united states by far  thank you new york  thank you  thank you governor cuomo  biden voted for the iraq war  i was against the iraq war  he opposed a mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed the killing of soleimani  you remember that one  he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and for the world  that's not a positive development  before they went into the wto  china was flat lined  for years and years and decades  flat lined  and then they got into the wto and a lot of bad things happened  first china's stole our jobs  plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus  and now china is trying to just hug and kiss joe biden  they want him so badly  look  if you like china  you should vote for biden  that i can tell you  how about his son  you think the son  maybe there's a conflict  how about his son  where's hunter  where is hunter  where is hunter  does anybody know  where's hunter  he's in another country right now  probably  ripping off another country  no  as soon as biden became vice president  bad things happened with respect to a hunter  if that happened with respect to my family  i wouldn't be standing  i guarantee you that  i guarantee you that  what a disgrace  what a disgrace  ukraine  and it's not just ukraine and it's not just china  but he goes into china  takes out  1 5 billion to manage  and he knows nothing  and he wasn't even employed  he got thrown out of the armed services  so give me a break  it's a disgrace  what's happening  there's a double窶ｦ there's a thing happening with the media like nobody's ever seen before  these people right here  because if that happened to a republican  in particular  if any of that stuff happened to me  it would be brutal  but it happened to him  they don't want to talk about it  and how about the questions asked by anderson cooper yesterday  anderson cooper  he's interviewed me a lot over the years and i always got along with him  but they were tough interviews  did you hear the questions  and biden kept looking down  i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter  right  i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter  and that's happened before  and how about david muir of abc  he's a nice guy  right  how soft were those questions  how soft were those  they don't ask me questions like that  they got fire pouring out of their eyes  no  ""mr  vice president  what do you think of this  how was your breakfast  sir  did you enjoy it "" when i banned travel from china biden  called it hysterical and xenophobic  he even used  somewhere along the line  the word racist  he always figures  they always want to get that word in there  if we had listened to joe  hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died  but instead my decision  saved thousands and thousands of lives  and then we banned europe very early because i saw what was going on  really in italy and spain and france  when the virus arrived  we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  mike pence did a great job  we produced more than 100 000 ventilators within weeks  and not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator  not one  you heard all about  and now we're producing ventilators  hard to produce  expensive  complex  we're producing them now for the rest of the world  188 countries were affected by this  we pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate  and you look at this  the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since april  think of that  85% since april  under operation warp speed  three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials  if you go back three years  that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss  it would have taken years  we will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus  it's already getting defeated  and by the way  another big democrat hoax  another big hoax  i want football back  i'm the one that's been saying  is that a correct statement  i want football back  these are young  strong guys  they're not going to be affected by the virus  if you look at it  it's generally older people  older people that have heart conditions  that have diabetes  that have problems  these are big strong guys  they'll be just fine  but i want football back  i've been calling for football to be back  including big 10  big 10  get with it  open up your season  big 10  and the dems don't want it back for political reasons  but now their new line窶ｦ this is like russia  russia  russia  all this crap they come up with  now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down  they want to keep it shut down  and they're saying that president trump shut it down  i'm the one that wants it open  so they're reversing it  they're playing a big con game  it's just a con game  and that's what we're dealing with  and we have to defeat them on november 3rd  i want football back and big 10 open  and now the other day  joe biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown  he'd be willing to do another blanket  and we had to do it  we blanket  we shut down  we saved millions of lives  instead of the number we have today  175 000  we could have had 2 million today instead  it would have been unacceptable  unsustainable  unsustainable  we did everything right  we did it right  we closed it down  we stopped china  we stopped europe  now we're opening it up and we're opening it up to record numbers  despite the fact that the democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states  shut down as long as possible  but now biden wants to do another blanket shutdown  possibly  that would decimate the economy and cause suicides  drug overdoses  alcohol abuse  heart attacks  joblessness  you'd have jobs  all of the problems that it causes  because it's not just a one sided equation  a shut down causes big problems also  and at this point  when the economy is roaring back  we had record job numbers this last quarter  over 9 million jobs  we're going to throw that all out  we have a market窶ｦ you know  your stock market  who has 401k's here  your 401k's and your stocks  when you have stocks  would be obliterated  and right now  we have just  on two of your markets  as you know  s p and nasdaq  you're at new records  and you're about to hit another new record  think of it  who would have thought the stock market  and hopefully we're at the end of this horrible china virus  came from china  they should have stopped it and they did  but who would have thought  just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now  record levels  and everything else is going to follow  before the virus  we created an economic miracle and now we're doing it again  we did the paycheck protection program where we saved more than 200 000 jobs in new hampshire alone  200 000  right  over the past three months  we've gained so many different  if you look at retail numbers  take a look at our retail numbers  they're literally at records  look at some of the numbers be announced by companies  they're at records  can you imagine giving that all up and starting again  it's not acceptable  if i'm reelected  we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months  and we'll do that easily  the biden agenda  with big tax increases and big regulation increases  would immediately kill everything  you will go into a depression  and i'm very good at predicting this  you will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929  and who knows  maybe worse than that  they are playing a suicide mission  窶ｦ be worse than that  they are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes  they want to raise your taxes by  4 trillion  and that's going to be almost everybody  they're saying for the rich  no  not for the rich  they're going to be raising everybody's taxes almost  joe biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in american history and of our foreign adversaries  we're devising a plan to destroy the united states from within  all they have to look is at the biden harris  how about her  is she a beauty  what a beauty that is  they pick a woman who starts off窶ｦ she starts off sort of strong  she's one of the favorites  within a period of a few months  she goes down  down 15  12  11  nine  eight  five  three  two  then she goes  ""i'm going to leave because i've decided that i want to leave  i want to leave "" she left because she wouldn't have gotten any votes  she was terrible  this would be your president possibly  i don't think so  i don't think so  i want to see the first woman president also  but i don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she's not competent  she's not competent  they're all saying we want ivanka  i don't blame them  they want to eliminate america's borders in the middle of a pandemic  suspend all deportations  restore catch and release  and expand horrible  dangerous  disgusting sanctuary cities  they want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers  that's what we need is more lawyers  let's get some more lawyers into the act  they want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations  very dangerous  and increase refugee admissions by 700%  this is in the bernie sanders  crazy bernie  you know crazy bernie  a lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time  you know why  because of trade  because i agree with bernie sanders  but my trade policies are much tougher than his and i'm able to do it  all you have to do is how is china doing last year with my trade policy  not too well  and we had the best year we've ever had  we're going to get a lot of bernie sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade  they really like it because i've been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by china and many other countries  including  i hate to say it  our allies  our allies have been ripping us big  and you heard me say last night  nato  i got  130 billion from them first time going up to  400 billion a year from nato countries  by saying  ""you got to do it  you got to do it "" and general secretary stoltenberg said it can't be done  he could not believe it  he's actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote  call him sometime  they want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement  they want to end窶ｦ we want to increase law enforcement  not cut law enforcement  and by the way  pat lynch is a great guy  new york  new york  really great  new york's finest  right  their rights have been taken away from them  literally they're not allowed to do their job  but pay lynch  he said the first time in history that they know of new york's finest have endorsed a candidate  the candidate is donald trump  first time they've done it  all over the country  the sheriffs of florida  all of texas  all over the country  ohio  law enforcement's endorsing trump  i cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements  if they do  please let me know and we'll have a little discussion  we'll ask why did that happen  they want to end school choice and ban charter schools  they want to abolish american energy  including all of the things i said before  and add to that coal and add to that shale  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  a bright future  the american dream for all americans  there is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years  so in conclusion  i have to say this  over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing super power of the world that's happening already  we will end our reliance on china once and for all  we'll do it here  like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars  we will hire more police  increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement  surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities  we will kill our terrorist's enemies as we've been doing while keeping america out of the endless foreign wars  i go to dover and i greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed  so sadly killed  it's such a shame  i go to the hospital  i go to walter reed medical center  it's incredible  the doctors are so talented  i see what they can do  but soldiers so badly hurt  and they're really acting as police  they're acting as police  now  we're very low in afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops  we're getting out  we'll be getting out soon  we're very low in iraq  we're very low in syria  except we kept the oil  we left some behind for the oil  if you don't mind  we kept the oil  we should have kept the oil in iraq like i've been saying  we'll appoint prosecutors  judges  and justices who believe in enforcing the law  not their own political agenda  which is what we have in many cases right now  the next president will be in my opinion  responsible for two  three  four  and maybe  maybe even five us supreme court justices  you better vote for me  you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech and the right to keep and bear arms  second amendment  we will surprise medical billing require  it's already done  i signed it  nobody can believe i did it  price transparency  you know what that is  do you know how big that is  where you're able to actually negotiate with hospitals  see their prices  compare it  you know who likes it  good hospitals and good doctors  other people don't like it  it's the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it  but i've already put it into effect  the bad news is it goes into effect on january 1st  you better make sure you elect me so i get credit for it  otherwise  could you imagine if sleepy joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped  but he said  ""i wonder what happened "" and i did it all  i'll be so angry at new hampshire  i'll never speak to you again  now  all these things  what we're doing with drugs  we instituted a favored nations laws  we instituted favored nations  that's going to drop your prices 50  60  70%  and i'm the only president in 51 years  last year  drug prices went down a little  not much  but they went down the first time in 51 years  favored nations could drop at 50  60  or 70%  on top of that  i instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman  so we will protect medicare and we will protect social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions  america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to plant its beautiful american flag  do we love our american flag  or mars  above all  we will teach our children to love our country  to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the new hampshire state motto  have you ever heard of these words  live free or die  live free or die  vote for those people  and you do  you have a great governor  vote for your people  vote for your governor  you have a great governor  from portsmouth to dixville from concord to keene  i know a friend from keene  great guy  i had a friend from keene a long time  keene  new hampshire  and merrimack to manchester  we will fight for every job  every family and every neighborhood  we will fight for every vote  we have to win  we have no choice  can i be honest with you  we're working hard  we're all working  i don't have to do this  i could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe  that was mine  but that's air force one  i get off that beautiful plane  i could come up and say  ""ladies and gentlemen of new hampshire  you have no choice  you have to vote for me because if you don't  you'll be put in radical lefties  you'll have a depression  your stocks will be worthless  your 401ks will be gone  there'll be crime all over your streets  so i'm not going to work at all  i'm leaving now  but you have to vote for me because you have no choice "" right  i could say it  right  right  we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans  blazed the trail  settled the continent  tamed the wilderness  laid down the railroads  won two world wars  defeated fascism and communism and made america the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater  we will be greater than ever before  incredible citizens like you  the people of new hampshire  helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country  we're not going to let it  we're returning power to you the american people  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one nation under god  and we don't take the beautiful word god out of our pledge of allegiance  do we  they did it twice  they it twice  then they say  ""well  we didn't mean that "" oh  i see  i was listening once they said  ""that's right "" you don't know what it is  what happened  what happened  they did it on purpose  they did it twice  that's where they're coming from  you can be fools and you can be fooled  but that's where they're coming from  so don't be surprised  but they're not going to get there  we're not going to let it happen  we're not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs  america will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of new hampshire that have meant so much to me  and i brought down opioid and i brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it  19  i talk about new hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country  of any state in this incredible country  you had one of the worst problems of any of the states  and i talk about you a lot  it was incredible  and you still have  but we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked  if it weren't for the china plague  the number would be 25 or 30%  that really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer  joe  don't you understand that  they don't want to be shut down  so i worked very hard on that for this state and for other states  but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem  that wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before  it's stopping them like never before  i want to thank new hampshire for all you've done for me  i want to thank new hampshire  you were my first victory  as i said  but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we've ever had  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america proud again  we will make

23,10,Feb,2020,datasets/NewHampshire,"hello  manchester  and i am thrilled to be in the great state of new hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god  family  and country  thank you  thank you  and i'll tell you what 窶 we have more in this arena  and i hate to say this to you窶ｦ we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in  so if you'd like to give up your seat or where you're standing窶ｦ sorry we couldn't get you seats  but if you want to give it up  let them come in  you go out  does anybody want to make that deal  i don't think so  but we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates  meaning the democrats  put together and multiplied times fave  and the fake news  these guys will never report that  they'll never report it  they don't even like showing the crowd  they always show my face  they never show the crowd  but you know what  the people can hear the crowd  the people can hear the crowd  they know  that is not the sound of 200 people  one of their prime candidates today  they worked a big deal  they had exactly 104 people  and the fake news said  ""it was a nice crowd  very nice "" if i had one empty seat here  one empty seat in this massive arena  they'd say  ""he didn't sell out "" but you know what  we have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and i came down the escalator  never  not one time  and we have the biggest arenas in the country  with your help on november 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats  we are going to win new hampshire in a landslide  this is a truly incredible time for america  we have the best economy we've ever had  the most prosperity  we have got the most prosperity we've ever had  by the way  we're going to keep it that way  too  if it's okay  who was mumbling  very distracting  very distracting  it's true  you know  it was very distracting  i'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me  angry  there was a little anger back there  we're the ones that should be angry  not them  we're the ones that should be angry  but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback  our country is stronger today than ever before  and the day after my address  our good republicans in the united states senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full  complete  and absolute  total acquittal  and it  wasn't even close and i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members  they were tremendous  in the house  we won 196 to nothing and then we got three democrats  and in the senate  other than romney  we got 52 to nothing  52 to nothing  that's something  and in one case we got 53 to nothing  but i don't even count that to be honest  the radical left's pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes窶ｦ think of that窶ｦ 18 votes to spare  with a lot of votes to spare  and also very importantly  as of today  i窶ｦ we  because it's not we  it's not i  it's we  we're all in this together  we have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had  thank you  nancy  very much  thank you  while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with this vile hoax  we've been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  enacting fair trade deals  securing our borders  and lifting up citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  from our rural communities to our cities  we are expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens  we added another 225 000 new jobs last month alone  amazing  and i listened  i watched  i had all these experts  they were saying  ""yes  i think 60 000 "" another one said 101 000  another one said 125  another one was 118  and then the number came out  225 000  pretty good  pretty good  we have destroyed the isis caliphate  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi is dead  al-baghdadi is dead  and we just took out the world's top terrorist  qasem soleimani  ending his evil reign of terror forever  the fact is  america is respected again  it's been a long time  but as we keep on winning  washington democrats keep on losing their minds  they're crazy  that's why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement  they're joining our great republican party  now  i can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here  right  remember last time  we won the primary tremendously  we should have won the election  but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts  hundreds and hundreds of buses  and it was very  very close even though they did  but this year we have a great governor  governor sununu  great governor  chris  and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did  so it should be a lot different  but we have done great  this has been an incredible state for us  it's a state where the people are great  just great people  and we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries  don't you  so i hear a lot of republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the democrats  does that make sense  you people wouldn't do that  my only problem is i'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate  i think they're all weak if you want to know the truth  we proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission  a very simple mission  remember  make america great again  and then after we make it great again  which we already have窶ｦ we've had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high  141  think about it  out of three years  141  and to me  i view it differently  well  look at your 401ks  i mean  who is doing well with their 401k  up 90%  up 104%  is there anybody doing badly with the 401k  i'd like to not talk to that person  does anybody have a 401k where they're doing badly  please  oh  don't put up your hand  i don't believe it  nah  the 401ks  they're up 90%  95%  i always tell this story  people come up to me  they say  ""i want to thank you  my wife thinks i'm a total loser  sir  she thinks i am the worst person with money  with financial  she thinks i'm just horrible  in the last three years  i'm up 94%  sir  she thinks i'm a total genius when it comes to finance  she loves me again  she didn't love me before  sir  she loves me again "" that tells you something about money  doesn't it  the first step to victory in november is tomorrow  go send a message that republicans窶ｦ and you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want  don't worry about it  i don't really think we actually have a candidate against us窶ｦ that republicans are energized  that we're united  and that nine months from now we are going to take back the house of representatives  we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house  you know  they always talk about the democrats  they have enthusiasm  right  we have so much more enthusiasm than them  it's not even close  they're all fighting each other  they're all going after each other  you got them all over the place  they don't know what the hell they're doing  they don't know what they're doing  they can't even count their votes  we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country  great national leaders  i want to thank our tremendous vice president  mike pence  who spoke earlier this evening  and also with us  our warrior senators  the two people that wanted to be here  they're going to be here tomorrow  they're going to be here to get out the vote  i don't think we have to worry too much about it  but that's okay窶ｦ and very highly respected  senators lindsey graham and rand paul  great guys  warriors  they're warriors  hey  lindsay and rand  that's not bad  can you imagine if you actually came from new hampshire what it would be  right  that's not bad  but they have been great  all they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said  ""read the transcripts please  read the transcripts "" but i want to thank you both very much  two great people  two great friends  man  look at all that television back there  whoa  that's bigger than those terrible academy awards  i've got to tell you  that used to be big  not so much anymore  a friend of mine  another great leader and somebody that's going to be speaker of the house hopefully next year  kevin mccarthy  our leader  kevin mccarthy  oh  will that be nice to have kevin  a pro  you'll see things get done like you'll never believe  thank you  kevin  very much  great  a very brave man窶ｦ he took a bullet  he got shot and he got up  he was going to die that night  i tell this story all the time  his wife  she was crying so much  when he finally did awake  i said  ""well  one thing i learned  your wife loves you "" ""why do you say that "" ""because she was devastated "" i know many wives that don't get too upset  his wife was devastated  his family was devastated  the doctor told me he didn't have a good chance  but he's tough as hell and he's a really terrific friend  he's a winner  he put himself back into shape  he actually looks better now than he did before he got shot  steve scalise  lot

they're good kids  they went through a lot with this hoax  i want to tell you  they went through a lot with the hoax  helping us was the rnc chairwoman  ronna mcdaniel  great job  i said  ""get me the woman from michigan to head up the rnc  who's that woman from michigan to head up the rnc "" thank you  ronna  great job  setting all kinds of records  polling records  contribution records  everything  we're doing everything so it's great  and tommy hicks  i want you to say hello  tommy hicks  who's a special friend  and haley  thank you  darling  i retweeted you  haley  i retweeted you all over the place  and all together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world  it's a great thing  it's a great thing  since my election  america's gained 7 million new jobs  the unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century  the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country  you believe that one  that's pretty amazing  that's pretty amazing  the unemployment rate among african americans  hispanic americans  and asian americans has reached record lows  all time  never been lower than what it is now  and by the way  our poll numbers with african americans  with hispanic americans  with asian americans  the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships  they're going up  african american youth unemployment is so important  it was a horrible number a few years ago  you remember  it was a really terrible thing was happening  it's just reached the lowest time in the history  lowest  the best number in the history of our country  and african american poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded  wages for african american workers have increased by  2 400 per year  also a record  and you know this  for decades  the democrat party has betrayed african americans  they betrayed us all  they betrayed all of us  but we're delivering for african americans  we're delivering for asian americans and hispanic americans like nobody has ever done  we are fighting for great jobs  great schools  great healthcare  and a truly great future for our country and for them  we are the party of equal opportunity for all americans  thank you  to support working families  we've reduced the cost of childcare  expanded paid leave  and given 40 million american families an average of  2 200 more in their pockets thanks to the republican child tax credit  who would have thought that  we have cut more job killing regulations than any窶ｦ you know this one  so you go back four years  eight years  in one case  longer than eight years  we've cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country  and we're not finished  we've ended the war on american energy  they want to take our energy away  they want to take our wealth away  they want to give us wind  wind  if it blows  wonderful  if it doesn't blow  you got problems  wind  they want to destroy our countrysides  put windmills all over them  watch your house go down in value  you ever see what happens  they build a windmill within distance of your house  you could forget about your house  you could just say  well  that was the end of that investment  you want to see a bird graveyard  go to the bottom of a windmill  take a look  it's a graveyard for birds  they kill all the birds  lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump  that's what we're doing  we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies  washington politicians窶ｦ you know this  they shuttered new hampshire factories  you were one of the worst examples ever  nafta  what nafta to your communities  i mean to your state  is incredible  shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism  we can forget globalism  we want to take care of our country  new hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of nafta and china's entrance into the wto  the world trade organization  one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country  for decades  politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace nafta  they lied  they never did it  they never even tried to do it  they wouldn't have been able to anyway  it wasn't easy  i will tell you that  but then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing  but i'm not like those other politicians  i keep my promises  we took care of it  we took care of it  you saw last month being bye-bye  i say donald j  trump  bye-bye nafta  we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new us mexico canada agreement into law  that's going to be great for our manufacturers  our farmers  great for everybody  great for our workers  the usmca will bring jobs back to new hampshire right where they belong  they should have never left in the first place  probably the number one reason i ran for office  i'm one for one  i have friends  some of these great senators  look at lindsey over there and look at rand  these great senators  sure  i've run five times and i've won three  and other senators said ""sir  i've won seven times  sir "" southern senator  ""i won seven times  sir  and i've won five of those damn contests "" i said  ""senator  i ran once and i won just once "" and we're going to run twice and that's going to be it  although they think we're going to run much more than that  you know that  right  it scares the hell out of the fake news  i will tell you  they can't take a joke  i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs  and our strategy worked  massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in  poured in by the billions and billions  we never took in 25 cents from china  they ripped us so much you wouldn't believe it  now they respect us again  last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defeat so many of our opponents  the money that's pouring in  people don't even believe it  and by the way  the virus  they're working hard  looks like by april  in theory when it gets a little warmer  it miraculously goes away  i hope that's true  but we're doing great in our country  china  i spoke with president xi and they're working very  very hard and i think it's going to all work out fine  rough stuff  i tell you  rough  rough stuff  but i think it's going to work out good  we only have 11 cases and they're all getting better  but our trade agreement with china will defend our workers  protect our intellectual property  and substantially boost exports of american made goods  is that nice  after years of building up other countries  we are finally rebuilding our country  on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than a thing called immigration  right  before i came into office  the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that's what they want  i see them campaigning right down the street  it's really boring to watch  but i try and watch  no  i have an obligation to watch really boring stuff  but they want open borders  they want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country  many of whom are not exactly what we're looking for  okay  i mean murderers  rapists  and some other things  they're going to be poisoning our children with drugs  including right here in new hampshire  and you have one of the drug problems in the country  and we brought it down 18% but we have to do better  18%  washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens  they want to let anyone into our country from all around the world  just come on in  folks  we're going to give you free healthcare  we're going to give you free education  we're going to give you more than our vets are getting  every family will get a free rolls royce  you know i said that  matt  i said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said  ""president trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free rolls royce  he lied  he lied  he lied "" they gave me a pinocchio  they don't get it  matt  do they  matt  actually they get it better than we understand  they get it very well  they get it  they know what's happening  and the wall is being built  i will tell you the wall is being built  and you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up  so what's happening  you do know who's paying for the wall  don't you  right  redemption from illegal aliens that are coming  the redemption money is paying for the wall  they're so sad to hear that because it's okay  finally  they go  you have to understand an entire party is fighting  they'll give me anything i want  our military would rebuilt it  2 2  it's really  2 5 trillion over a period of three years  they give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall  they said  ""we like drones "" well  drones don't keep people out  drones are wonderful  they fly around  take pictures  we're going to give you a drone  no good  so we now have built over 100 miles of wall  and when we have that wall built  you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in  i say they can't come in  they don't come in  so we up to over a hundred  substantially more than a hundred miles of wall  and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future  and by the way  you have to see  you wouldn't believe it  you have to see what happens when that wall goes up  you have to see the numbers change like magic  they change like magic  you ever hear the thing with all the modern technology  all of the new computers  the new genius  the new everything  cyber this  cyber that  two things never change  right  a wheel and a wall  right  a wheel and a wall  they're going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years  they're never going to replace the wheel and they're never going to replace the wall  and it's a high wall  illegal immigrants coming in  coming into our country illegally  very few of them are getting in right now  mexico has been terrific  we have 27 000 mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year  and for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants  we could rebuild the cities in america  we could rebuild our cities  but i have something  because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies  read the snake  the snake  does anybody know what i'm talking about  she knows  she's been standing outside for four days  no wonder  and you look good  i'll tell you what  four days outside in the rain and snow  look at these front row people  these are warriors  they're warriors too  like my congressmen and senators  i made minor changes  they mentioned illegal immigration  this is about immigration  this was a song from the 1950s  al green  and they mentioned little changes to it  that's okay  but they mentioned illegal immigration  right  and i used to do this a lot and people couldn't get enough of it  to be honest with you  and i haven't done it for a while  and i thought i'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders  they want open borders  and we don't want open borders  we want very strong closed borders  and we want people to come into our country  but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally  right  right  through merit and legally  right  so we'll do this quickly  this is illegal immigration  it's called窶ｦ oh  listen to how quiet it is  listen to how quiet  now watch how quiet it gets  gets so quiet  but this is all about窶ｦ i love you too  that was a guy that said that  but i love him too  i love everybody  ready  so important  illegal immigration  on our way to work one morning down the path along the lake  a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake  his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew  ""poor thing "" she cried  ""i'll take you in and i'll take care of you "" take me in  oh tender woman  take me in for heaven's sake  take me in  oh tender woman  sighed the vicious snake  she wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk  she hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived  she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully  fully revived  take me in  oh tender woman  take me in for heaven sake  take me in  oh tender woman  sighed that vicious snake  she clutched him to her bosom  ""you're so beautiful "" she cried  ""but if i hadn't brought you in by now  you truly would have died "" she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight  but instead of saying thank you  the snake gave her a vicious bite  take me in  oh tender woman  take me in for heaven's sake  take me in  oh tender woman  sighed the vicious snake  ""i saved you "" cried the woman  ""and you've bitten me  but why  you know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die "" ""shut up  silly woman "" said the reptile with a grin  ""you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in "" got to come in legally and through merit  under my administration we're fully taking care of our own citizens first  including millions of african american and hispanic americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities  in this region of the country alone last year  ice officers窶ｦ we love our ice officers  the democrats don't like them  the democrats don't like them  ice officers are the toughest human beings  and they love the country as much as anybody in this room  last year alone they 窶ｦ in this room  last year alone  they arrested over 2 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery  rape  and murder  over 2 000 accused of murder  yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the american community  one of guests at the state of the union was american citizen  jody jones  i introduced him that night  his beloved brother  rocky  was murdered by a criminal alien in california  shot him eight times at close range  wouldn't stop  rocky's killer had been previously arrested many  many times  but under california's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law  authorities were ordered to set him free  tragically  left wing politicians in new hampshire tried to replicate california's disastrous policies  last year  the democrat controlled new hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state  and by the way  you have a great governor  chris sununu  he's on top of it  he's on top of it  and his father is a great guy  his father didn't like me too much a few years ago  once i won  i'm telling you  he was so good  he was as good  he fought like hell for us  all of us  it's a great family  and chris is doing a fantastic job  if you want to shut down sanctuary cities  if you want to protect your family and your loved ones  you must vote republican in 2020  november  and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row  illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we've ended catch and release  you know what catch and release is  you catch an illegal alien by law  you then take his name and address  they don't have addresses  what's your address  what  they don't have addresses  they come into the country  they don't have addresses  so you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say  ""we'll see you in four years for your court case "" we never see them  they never come back  we have seized record amounts of drugs  we have deported record numbers of gang members  ms-13 by the thousands  and we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history  窶ｦ does anybody know who won iowa  i don't know  maybe rander  lindsey  grant  does anybody know who won  lindsey  you're a total pro  nobody knows  he said nobody  flip a coin  flip a coin  flip a coin  they're going to run your health care  unbelievable  nobody knows who won  actually  i think they're trying to take it away from bernie again  i think bernie came in second  can you believe it  they're doing it to you again  bernie  they're doing it to you again  we're saving your healthcare while these socialist democrats are trying to take away your healthcare  we are making healthcare better and much  much cheaper  you've seen what we did  we are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will  the republican party always will  always will  and we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world  the individual mandate  we had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune  you paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare  and we got rid of it  saved a lot of money for a lot of people  and we're stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent  that's bigger than healthcare transparency and that'll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time  it would be nice if we could get it earlier  but it's all done  it's all signed  because when providers are required to show you what the prices are  those prices are going to come tumbling down  blood tests as an example  one hospital has them for  53  another hospital  the same test   2 415  same exact test  and it may even be better  who knows  we're approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country  that's bringing prices down  we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan  remember president obama  you could keep your plan  you could keep 28 times  you can keep your doctor  that didn't turn out very good  we should impeach him for that  why aren't we impeaching him  28 times  you can keep your doctor  we should impeach president obama  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion

back  they'd go back to their ways  i mean  in many cases i guess they had no choice  it was a disaster  now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with

24,16,Sep,2019,datasets/NewMexico,"wow  thank you  thank you  new mexico  thank you  we love being with you  we love being with you  incredible people  incredible people  thank you very much  and i'm thrilled to be here in albuquerque with thousands of hard-working  freedom-loving american patriots  thank you  incredible  we're all united by the same love of our great country  and by the way  our country is doing great  you see it  the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by  the eternal grace of almighty god  good night to that person  tomorrow they'll say  ""massive protest "" no  one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner  good night  but we're bound by these convictions  we will campaign for every vote  and we will win the great state of new mexico in 2020  and by the way  you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in  so we love you  we love you  we appreciate it  we try to get the biggest arena we can get  and they're never big enough  frankly  so there's something going on  and i always say  2016  i don't know if there'll ever be another 2016  but right now it's like a great tree or a great plant  you plant it and it has to take hold  we have to win 2020  we're doing so well  we have to win 2020  and every day  and you know as well as i do  we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past  and we're achieving historic victories for the american people  we're winning again  we're winning again  and we're winning big  we're winning big  crucially for your state  we have ended the last administration's war on american energy  and since my election  natural gas productions  big story today  in new mexico has increased by 40%  4-0  and that means great wages  and it means jobs  and that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book  crude oil production in new mexico has more than doubled  and going up a lot higher very quickly  and your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds  think of that  two-thirds  and that's in a short period of time  give me a little bit more time  okay  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  and this means more jobs  higher wages  and american energy independence  which is what we have  a few years ago  if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the middle east  we would've been in a panic  although  not if i were your president  we never panic  we don't want to panic  but a few years ago  they would have been in a panic  today we got a lot of oil  we got a lot of gas  we got a lot of oil and gas  we don't have to send too many boats over there  did you notice the other day  they were saying  ""we don't see too many american ships anymore "" you know why  because we don't need 窶ｦ we're independent  as independent as we want  and we are now a net exporter of energy  revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future  and they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in new mexico  thank you very much  president trump  thank you  now  under the green new deal  that all goes away  that all goes away  it all goes away  you can forget it  no more cows  no more airplanes  no more trips  a single car  make it electric  single car  you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles  they'll call us ""the hermit nation "" we'll never leave our house  no  it's crazy  but that's okay  i don't want to bring it up because i don't want to do it too early  maybe they'll change  and i don't want them to change  but think of it for you  and for texas  and for so many other places  they want to get rid of your energy  i mean  explain that one  explain that  yet  every major democrat running for president  they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas  in other words  the democrats want to completely annihilate new mexico's economy  the democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers  they want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes  that's not happening anymore  it's been a long time  it's been a long time  it's not happening anymore  but democrats will never get the chance because new mexico will never give them that chance  under this administration  america is working again  america is winning again  and america is respected again  like it hasn't been for a long time  and i can tell you because i meet so many of the leaders  and their presidents  and their kings  and their queens  and their prime ministers  and their everything  dictators every once in a while  every once in a while  you get an a rogue dictator  and i'll tell you  they always start off  today i had the crown prince of bahrain  and they come in and they say  ""sir  i'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the united states  it's a model for the entire world "" they all say it  and earlier today 窶ｦ do we have any baseball fans  right  right  you know what i'm going to say  but earlier today in the white house  i had the honor of awarding the presidential medal of freedom  that's the highest civilian award  to someone who truly embodies the american dream  baseball legend  the greatest  by the way  the greatest relief pitcher of all time  you look at those records  mariano rivera  he was something  the yankees won a lot of world series because of mariano  great guy  we gave him the medal  done so much for charity  a fantastic man  fantastic family  it was a beautiful day at the white house  so it was good  my administration is fighting to empower all americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential  we have created six million new jobs since election day  the fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign  even as a projection  unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years  more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps  nearly 600 000 americans came into the labor force last month alone  think of that  wages in your state  new mexico  are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year  which is unheard of 20 years ago  and i used to say during the campaign  you go back  it's hard to believe  i'm here almost three years 窶ｦ can you believe how time is flying  can you believe it  i don't know about it me  but you look all much better than you did three years ago  you're wealthier  and even with the me too movement  we can't say this  but i'll say it anyway  you're better looking  including the men  including the men  now you're all looking good  since my election  the number of new business applications for new mexico has increased by almost 30%  more than any state in the united states  think of that  more than any state in the united states  so essentially  that's saying you're in a certain category  which is a very important category  you're doing better than any state in the united states  how do i lose new mexico  explain that one  right  how do we lose that one  and yet  for whatever reason  it's been quite a while since a republican won this state  but we're going to win this state  and i think we're going to win this state easy  you had to see the people all the way in from the airport  that was a long drive by the way  35 minutes  that was a long drive  but all the way in  we had people  and they were waving  and i didn't see any negative hand gesture  right  no  i think we're going to do great here  and we're here for a number of reasons  but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a republican state  yesterday marked the beginning of the hispanic heritage month  who is hispanic here  latinos for trump  thank you  incredible people  but we have much to celebrate  unbelievable when you think  the unemployment for hispanic-americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country  hispanic-american poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history  and after years of stagnation that you know very well  wages for hispanic-americans are rising really fast  up nearly 8% since my election  those are unheard of numbers  they're unheard of  and median income  think of that  median income for hispanic-americans surpassed  50 000 for the first time ever  that's your median  that's not bad  that means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast  and i just want to tell you it's an honor  but when i'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical democrats  whoever it may be  and they start telling you what they're going to do for you  and you say  ""but we have the best numbers  every category  that we've ever had "" hispanic-americans 窶ｦ excuse me  new mexico as a whole  we have the best numbers  african-americans  the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country  asian-americans  the best numbers that we've ever had in history  women  the best numbers that we've had in 71 years  we're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's hispanic-american citizens  including millions and millions of extraordinary mexican-americans who enrich our society  strengthen our country  serve in our military  and contribute immensely to our shared american family  and i want to just tell you that mexico is doing a great job for us on the border  and i want to thank the president of mexico  you know  it's very interesting  i hear everybody screaming  well  you know we're building the wall  and it's going up  and it's going up fast  and if you think that's easy with the democrats who control the house  we have to take it back  but if you think it's easy 窶ｦ but we're building a lot of wall  we'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year  and it's making a big difference  500 miles  but you know we won a big case two months ago in the supreme court that allowed us to do what we're doing  this has been 窶ｦ i'll tell you what  ready  another president would have given up a long time ago  we don't give up  so we're building the wall  the army corps of engineers  we're doing a beautiful job  it's a great  it's a great structure  it's a great structure  you're going to have to really want to get over that wall  to do it  but it was very interesting because  not too long ago  i saw where the hispanic-american  the hispanics  were up with me in a poll  17%  and everyone said  ""how is that  how is that  how is that  17%  up by 17%  i won't even tell you what the final number was because they won't believe it  but you're going to see what the final number 窶ｦ but you know why  because the hispanic-americans  they understand  they don't want criminals coming across the border  they don't want people taking their jobs  they want to have that security  and they want the wall  they want the wall  and we have a man in the audience who is  i think  the best dressed man in this entire place  including me  right here  look at him  come here  look at him  look at this guy  and he's been to a couple of rallies too  haven't you  huh  we have some people  a group of people the other day  you know  we had a victory in north carolina that was unbelievable  two of them  one of them  it was going to be very  very close  here's another one of my friends  thank you  i like that beautiful red tie you're wearing  but we had a victory  two victories  north carolina  where one was 17 points down three weeks ago  we got involved  we started sending out lots of different social media messages  we did a couple of little robo calls  but the big thing  we did a speech the night before  the turnout was beyond belief  and instead of being down by 17 points  he easily won the election 4 000 or 5 000 votes  dan  thank you  dan  thank you  dan bishop  and greg murphy was up a couple of points  and he ended up winning  i don't know  i'd ask the media  but they won't give me how many 窶ｦ what did he get  do you know  like 20  21  he won by a lot  he won by a lot  i'd asked them  but we're not going to get a straight answer  they were not happy  they were not happy  i'll tell you  tuesday night  the fake news was not happy  they had their studios all built  cnn had their a- list talent  they don't have a-list talent  but they had the best they could have  and they were all set  this was going to be the end of trump  because this man was going to lose  but he turned out to be tough and smart  and in all fairness  i helped a lot too  and toward the end of the night  they started dismantling that studio  probably it would have been there for four weeks  this is the end  but we had two great victories  congressional victories  on tuesday night  and it was something  the one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible  so much  and the other won a race that he was way  way  way back  in fact  i shouldn't tell you this  but my geniuses  my people  some of those people standing right there  right there  some of them right there  they said  ""sir  don't get involved in that race  sir  you can't come back from 17 points  sir  it's too much "" i said  ""but you know  i really like the guy  i think he's great  let's give it a shot "" they say  ""sir  if you lose  they will never  ever 窶ｦ it'll be much worse "" i said  ""let me tell you  i know them very well  whether i help him or don't help him  it's going to be the same  it's going to be a disaster  so let's help him "" and we campaigned  and we worked hard  right  they said  ""don't do it  sir  don't do it  please don't do it  sir  it'll be very embarrassing "" i said  ""no  i don't mind being embarrassed  i don't mind being embarrassed "" we're also very proud that unemployment among native americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades  and we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background  race  religion  color  and creed  and that's what we have  that's what we have  race  religion  color  and creed  but the radical left democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained  they want to raise your taxes  they want to bury you in regulation  they want to take away your health insurance  180 million americans  they want to erase american history  crush religious liberty  indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology  and left-wing democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your god-given right to self-defense  you know that  as your president  i will never allow them to take away your liberty  your dignity  and your social security  and i will never  ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms  the left tries to threaten  bully  intimidate americans into submission  they use democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can  they'll do whatever they can to demean you  to libel you  they try to blacklist  coerce  cancel  or destroy anyone who gets in their way  look at what they're doing today to justice kavanaugh  look at what they're doing  did you see the new york times  did you see what they're doing  did you see what democrats  they're calling for his resignation  they're calling for his impeachment  and the woman involved said she didn't know anything  but they still  so the new york times had to put out a major apology  and they had to change their story  the woman said  ""i don't remember that "" can you believe  and they still want him to be impeached  and i just put out a statement  and he's a great man  by the way  a great talent  a great brilliant man  brett kavanaugh  and i just put out a statement on social media that said  i don't think they'll do it  but they should  for the good of the nation  ""i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story "" and while you're at it  the russian witch-hunt hoax  which is just as phony a story  they've taken  the old gray lady  do you know the new york times  for years  the old gray lady  so prestigious  they've taken the old great lady and broken her down  destroyed her virtue  and ruined her reputation  she can never recover  and will never return to greatness under current management  the times is dead  long live the new york times  long lived the new york times  and i do want it to live  but they have to be  they have to change their ways  think of it  they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this  can you even believe it  and yet  all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country  with all that we have going  with saudi arabia  with iran  with china trade deal  with russia  with north korea  with all that we have going  look at the cards that we've been dealt  lucky we won the election in 2016  believe me  with all that we have going  they say  ""let's impeach justice kavanaugh "" one of the smartest  most brilliant students  top at yale  incredible life  incredible family  ""let's impeach him "" it's a made-up story  ""let's impeach president trump "" think of that  the muller report came out  think of this  this crazy mueller report comes out  18 trump haters  liberal democrats  some worked for hillary clinton  they found nothing  no  think of it  after two years  they found nothing  they spent  40 million  there's not a person in the room that i couldn't find something on with that  they spent  think of it  they found nothing  no collusion  no obstruction  no nothing  to stop the far left's campaign of destruction  you must vote republican  and you're going to get the chance very soon  we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders  and somebody that's done an incredible job  she ran michigan for me  and as you know  for the presidential races  michigan hadn't been won in decades  and she kept saying  ""could you come back  sir "" i didn't know who she was  i said  ""who the heck is the woman in michigan that keeps asking "" she said  ""sir  if you keep coming back  you're going to win michigan "" hasn't been won in decades  and i won michigan  remember that great  great night  november  that great  great night  ""donald trump has won the great state of michigan "" and they were going crazy on television  they were going  that was not a good night- going crazy on television  they were going  that was not a good night for certain people  remember the couple of people that were crying  i guess they don't like a strong military  they don't like cutting regulations  they don't like low taxes  they don't like right to try  you know right to try  all these things we've done  for the vets  we got choice  we got choice for the vets  choice  everybody said it was impossible  we've rebuilt our military  i told this story for the first time today  a general came into my office in my first few weeks  you remember  it was a little dangerous out there  president obama left us with a few beauties  right  and i said to this general  ""you better be prepared  because this is looking like it could really be conflict "" and he looked at me and he goes  ""sir  we have very little ammunition "" i said  ""say it again "" and i want to tell you the words  very little  he didn't use because it was less than that  and i said  ""i never want to see a president in a position like that  where we may have conflict  and a general looks at him and said  窶聾e have very little/ no ammunition '"" i never want a president of the united states to be in that position  and since then  three years   700 billion we've spent  then  716 billion  and now   738 billion  and our military is by far the greatest in the world  there's nobody that even comes close  so anyway  no president should ever be put in that position  and by the way  no president should ever have to go through what i've gone through either  that should never happen  what happened is a disgrace to our country  no president should ever have to go through it  and i'll tell you what  99% of them would never have been able to take it  they wouldn't have been able to take it  but we won the great state of michigan  and now we're doing really well  because we've moved a lot of car companies  i tell japan  sorry  big deficits with all these countries  we're changing it  but you've got to get car companies  we're building car companies now in michigan  they're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries  including china  including mexico  they're going to stay home  and they're going to pay you a lot of money  and everybody's going to be happy  but michigan's doing great  and ronna mcdaniel was the republican party chair of michigan  so when we won the election  i said  ""let's get the woman from michigan to run the rnc "" and she has done an incredible job  thank you ronna  a great gentleman who loves the republican party  co-chairman  tommy hicks  tommy  what a job  new mexico republican party chairman  steve pearce  my friend and a really talented guy  he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time  brad parscale  what a job he's doing  brad  great job  brad  great job  and another great friend of mine  somebody that was on cnn  and they didn't like him because he was too positive on trump  can you believe it  he happens to be hispanic  he happens to be hispanic  but i've never quite figured it out  because he looks more like a wasp than i do  so i haven't figured that one out  but i'll tell you what  there is nobody that loves his country more or hispanic more than steve cortez  steve  thank you steve  nobody loves the hispanics more  who do you like more  the country or the hispanics  he says the country  i don't know  i may have to go for the hispanics to be honest  we got a lot of hispanics  we love our hispanics  get out and vote  you know  just before the last election  the cubans from miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote  close to 90%  they gave me the bay of pigs award  can you imagine  right  the bay of pigs award  and the venezuelans and the cubans are all for trump  i will tell you that  they're all for trump  they like what we're doing  with the help of  and steve  i want to thank you very much by the way  and you were incredible on cnn  and now you'll get a real job  okay  steve  that audience wasn't big enough for you  their ratings aren't good  with the help of everyone here tonight  we're taking power out of washington and giving it back to the great people of our country  and to the people of new mexico  we've cut a record number of job-killing regulations  saving the average american household  3 000  we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history  what that means is a typical family of four in new mexico making  75 000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than  2 000  and it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great  you look at europe  and you look at asia  and china's not doing too well  i must be honest with you  worst year in 57 years  i'd say that's not good  but i hope they still like me  and we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs  and we've given those tariffs  and by the way  china's eating the tariffs  they're devaluing their currency  the prices are very similar  they're eating the tariffs  and out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers  because they were targeted by china  because china knows  very smart  that the farmers love trump  and trump loves the farmers  i said to our secretary of agriculture  sonny perdue  i said  ""sonny  how much did the farmers get hit by china targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things "" he said  "" 16 billion "" i said  ""that's okay  we'll take  16 billion out of a much  much  much larger number  we're going to give it to the farmers  so that they're even "" and i tell you  the farmers do love trump  they do love trump  and to keep new mexico's farms  ranches  and small businesses in the family  we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax  so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children  now  if you don't like your children  don't do it  but when it's your time to kick the bucket  you worked hard  you have great kids  you love your kids  they're taking care of you  you really love them  it's a great thing  if you don't love them  don't even listen to the last line  because it won't matter  don't leave it to them  if they're not good  leave it to charity  leave it to something else  don't get it to them  i know a guy who can't stand his children  they're horrible  horrible human beings  they're a little older now  but they're horrible human beings  he wants to leave his wealth  i said  ""why would you leave them  they don't even like you "" but on the assumption that you love your children  you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things  you'll be able to leave them to your children  your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax  they won't be losing it to the banks five years later  we got rid of it  that's a big deal  thank you  thank you  our shared republican agenda is pro-worker  pro-jobs  pro-family  pro-growth  and 100% pro-american  for many decades  our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests  you know that  in new mexico  you know exactly what i'm talking about  people came in  they took your jobs  they had no border  they had no border control  look at what's going on now  how we're doing  i mean  honestly  i mentioned the president of mexico  we have today 27 000 mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country  and i'll take it  because our laws are so bad  they're so pathetic  and the democrats could change these laws  they could change them so quickly  we could change them all in less than an hour  we could  whether it's asylum  whether it's any of the laws  we have so many of them that are so bad  how they got that  it took years and years to end up  but we have the mexican soldiers out there  you see them  and they're stopping people  the numbers are plummeting down  so i just want to thank all of the representatives of mexico  amazing  well  we've got to get rid of the loopholes  you know  the word is loopholes  and the democrats could do it fast  but in the meantime  we're doing really well  and as the wall goes up  it becomes less and less of a problem  because as the wall gets up  people aren't getting through  i mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter  or a world class mount everest type climber  there's not too many around like that  it's really doing the trick  the failed liberal establishment in washington squandered your tax dollars  shipped away your jobs  sacrificed your sovereignty  and bogged us down in one foreign war  or debacle  call it whatever you want after another  and that's changing also  you see what's happening  and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year  billions and billions and billions  and they're rich  and they take our business and we're supposed to  on top of everything else  i could tell you stories  but i'm going to save them for the campaign  because to be honest  this is a little earlier than the campaign  wait until this campaign starts  you know  like i was telling brad and i was telling a few of the folks  one thing i don't want to do  michael back there  michael  hello  what a job he's done  but i'm telling them i don't want to do this too early  i don't want to do it  you know the pocahontas thing  i did that  it was before its time  right  it was before it's time  too early  1 024  that means i have more indian blood than she does  and i have none  unfortunately  i'd like to say i have a lot  got to get me another 4%  maybe another 10%  but i was early with her  and frankly  oh it's coming back  don't worry about her  but those days are over under this administration  we are finally putting america first  putting it first  we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land  you see the factories  empty buildings  empty hulks  some have been demolished  some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing  but all those jobs are gone  and we're bringing them back  they're coming back like almost never before  probably  i can say they're coming back like never before  people are coming back now  because they want to be where the action is  and this is the country where they have the security  and where they do have the action  in my first week in office  i proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying窶ｦ and this was a catastrophe  you know  the trans-pacific partnership  tpp  this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country  now new mexico  you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as nafta  your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after nafta was signed  this was one of the great catastrophes  and now we're replacing nafta with the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement  usmca  think of the song ymca  ymca  think of the song  usmca  that's us-mexico-canada agreement  and it's drawing strong bipartisan support from all across your state  and all across the country  it's amazing  i want to just  yeah  the dona ana county board of commissioners  all democrats just unanimously endorsed the usmca  and urged congress to pass it immediately  thank you very much commissioners  all democrats  hopefully they'll put it up for a vote  nancy pelosi  they put it up for vote  it's going to be very popular  the republicans love it  and the democrats love it  and frankly  labor loves it  unions love it  farmers love  love  love it  and everybody wants it  your farmers  your ranchers  everybody wants it  it's an incredible agreement  and mexico's already passed it  and canada's ready to pass it  soon as we do  see  they don't maybe trust us  that's why  they say  ""why aren't you passing it now "" they say  ""oh  we'll pass it "" they're going to pass it as soon as we do  past leaders invited china to freely loot and pillage the united states economy  china's been taking out from 300 billion to  500 billion a year  billion  not million  billion  think of what  500 billion is  we've rebuilt china  but now it's a different ball game  somebody had to do something with china  president obama should have done it  presidents bush should have done it  president clinton should have done it  they all should have done it  frankly  they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now  so if you look at it  nobody did it  so i'm doing it  and that's what's going to happen  we're doing well  so now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from china  when in the past  we never got 25 cents  we never got money  we never got anything  you know what we got  unemployment and losses  and some cheap pencils  more than we needed  you could do with one less pencil  following decades of outsourcing and offshoring  our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong  if foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs  there is one very simple solution  come and make your product in america  come and make your product in new mexico  and by the way  i'm just seeing this great group of people  this spirit  is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a trump rally  really  is there anything  when you think about it  it's not about fun  it's about achievement  because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled  there's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve  in a few short weeks  we'll be up to 180  sounds impossible  federal judges including court of appeals judges  because president obama did us a great favor when i came in  i said  ""i assume i have no judges to appoint "" no sir  you have 138 judges  138  didn't put them up  couldn't get them approved  i don't know what happened  but we started off with 138  now we're up to 180  i just signed my 150th federal judge  and court of appeals judge  and we already have two great supreme court justices  gorsuch  and kavanaugh  great  great men  so think of that  you know  you come in  and i've always heard the most important thing a president does  i disagree with this by the way  but that's okay  i disagree with a lot of things  because i think the most important thing is our military  and protecting our country  right  but have you listened to the so-called washington elite  now why are they elite  we do better than they do  we're smarter than them  we make more money  we have better houses  we have better everything  and then they say the elite  that means you're the super elite  i've always take offense when somebody said  ""president trump is tired of listening to the elite "" i said  ""no  no  i'm more elite than them "" right  i think so  i mean  if we go by the old standards  better houses  better schools  made much more money  lived better  had everything going  and then i decide to run for president  and i'll be honest  while we have to put up with these people  and others are  it's incredible  but it's the greatest single decision i've ever made  because our country is turning around so rapidly  i could not be happier  despite what they put us all through  could not be happier  after years of building up other countries  we're finally building up our country  isn't that nice  it's time to finally take care of our own  and we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic  which is horrible  and as a result of our nonstop efforts  and billions and billions of dollars invested  last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths  and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades  30 years  and at the center of america's drug crisis  this is where the hispanics know it better than anybody  people said  ""oh  the hispanics won't like a wall "" i said  ""i think they're going to love it "" they won't like border security  i think they going to love it  you know why  because you understand it better than other people  but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in  and you understand that when other people don't understand it  the border crisis  every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your southern border  including heroin  meth  cocaine  and fentanyl  and we're stopping them now  you see the kind of numbers  we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth  we've had some shipments where it could kill half of the country  some of the fentanyl and some of the bad  really bad stuff  if it were distributed  it could actually  has the power to kill half of the country  this is like a warlike situation  that's why you're liking trump  because you're not going to let that happen  if you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers  how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women  that's what they traffic in  it's women  they're not trafficking in men  they capture women  and they bring them across the open borders  and they don't go through ports of entry  where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else  they go out into the desert areas  and they hang a left  or they hang a right and they come in  but now when you have a wall  they can't do that  right  they can't do that  and so many of these democrats that are against the wall  it's common sense  look  you know what i saw the other day  where the democrats are having their convention  their national convention  they just gave out a tremendous contract  you know what it's for  they're building a big wall around the building  they're building a big wall  a massive wall  we should tell them  open borders  let anybody come in  and a few years ago  almost every one of these  they're on tape  that's the problem with politics  three years ago  they could say  look  i saw senator schumer  i saw nancy窶ｦ i saw all of them  they said  ""no  we need a wall  we must have a wall "" president obama  ""we must have a wall  we must stop people from coming into our country illegally  we have to stop it  we need a wall "" now  a few years later  they don't want a wall  you know why  because anything i want  they want to do the opposite  and that's okay  that's the only reason  but if you want to stop the drug smugglers  human traffickers and vicious ms-3 gang members  which we're taking out every year by the thousands  and getting them the hell out of our country  because of ice  and if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth  you know it's poisoning our youth  that's what it is  it's nothing other than that  it's very simple  they're poisoning our youth  you have only one choice  you must elect republicans  and to be honest with you  you've got to elect president trump  we need four more years  president trump  how about these phony democrats  they started with russia  russia  russia  that turned out to be be a fraud  that turned out to be a fraud  then they went to race  do you believe that one  race  i'm the least racist person in this room  then they went to recession  there's going to be a recession  oh please  let there be a recession  please  because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession  and unfortunately  the stock market's only a few points from its all time high  which we've broken on  i think it's well over a hundred times  we broke the all time record  and now they have a new one  and i'm enriching myself  let me tell you  by doing this and taking this particular job  which i love  it will cost me billions and billions of dollars  but if somebody from the middle east that i never saw before  comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening  and pays  439  emoluments  nobody ever heard the word emolument before  emolument  nobody ever heard that word  emolument  he's enriching himself  if somebody buys a tank of gas in scotland  from an airport that i don't own  and they happen to go to a hotel  he's enriching himself  like 20 people  i'm going to lose billions of dollars  and that's okay  i expected to do that when i did it  i didn't know what would happen if i lost  can you imagine  supposing i lost  and we would have had the same basic rhetoric  i mean  winning was great  supposing  you know  i'm doing all the things  i'm telling you all the same sort of things  supposing i didn't make it  i'd have to go around  i would've lost and lost billions  then i would have been really unhappy  but i'll tell you what  i expected that when i did this  in terms of opportunity  in terms of certain places  they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric  they can never do  so i'll lose billions of dollars  always expected  they say  i enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel  it doesn't work that way folks  and these are very  very dishonest people  and they know it  so they've given up on every other hoax  but it doesn't work that way  you know it too  you get it  the democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities  and your schools  and your hospitals  and public safety all at the expense of hardworking new mexico families  and throughout our country  sheriffs  and commissioners from nine mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in new mexico  they don't want open borders  they don't want criminals pouring into your communities  and doing what they do  and we won't even talk about that  they want strong  these are people that are with you in many cases  democrats  they write letters  we need strong border security  in san diego  california is very difficult  always complaining  not doing great  but they wanted a wall in san diego  good mayor in san diego by the way  they wanted a wall  and i said  ""you know what  let's build it someplace else "" because california  you know  once we build it  they'll complain  but then i said  ""you know  the people are pouring in "" they needed it  they're pouring into san diego  like going all over the place  and people that had houses  they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long  coming in from the other side  so we put up a wall  and i thought everybody would be happy  as soon as it was finished  the day it was finished  i was notified  we didn't want the wall  why did you do the wall  and i will tell you  in other words  it's all a game  i'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to new mexico  and if i did that  they'd go crazy  and they'd say  ""please sir  don't do that  please  please "" the same people that are saying  ""we don't want a wall  why did you put up a wall "" and i knew that was going to happen  i told my people that was going to happen  but they're very happy with their wall  most of them won't say it  they love it  it stopped窶ｦ it only stopped 99 9% of the people coming in  and the only reason i'm not moving it to new mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new  beautiful wall  so i'll give you a brand new beautiful wall  窶ｦ new beautiful wall  i'll give you a brand-new one  it's true  it's true  i actually priced it out  it's true  these contractors  all my life i've been deal窶ｦ they can find a way to make money  ""sir  it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one "" they have it  but the commission your commissioners wrote  i quote  ""our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing "" this is your commissioners writing to us in washington  our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens  you  and our existing homeless populations  many of whom are american veterans  right  so  democrats put illegal aliens before american citizens  republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first  i'm sorry  that includes millions of hardworking  lawful immigrants who waited in line  followed the rules  and came into our country legally  and among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are hispanic americans who obey our laws  pay their taxes  contribute to our communities and play by the rules  and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it  whether you're a first generation or a 10th generation  every american citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs  your safety  your family  and is always loyal to you  your politicians have not been loyal to you  they have been loyal to themselves  the democrats are also trying to turn every city in america into a sanctuary for criminal aliens  and that's one of the very good reasons we won on tuesday night  north carolina  because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did  i will not tell you tonight  but it wasn't good  it's one of the reasons we had big victories  two of them in north carolina  sanctuary cities  and plenty of people  even in california where they have sanctuary cities  they don't want sanctuary cities  the politicians do  but they don't want them  right here in new mexico  democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state  creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail  now  think of it  they want to make your whole state a sanctuary state  so  when ms-13 comes in  and i told you before  we take them out by the thousands and they're tough  they're tough  but our ice folks are even tougher  there's nobody tougher  i would say naive  but maybe it's much worse than that  they're naive  these politicians  the naive politicians  they don't want ice to come in  they don't want to take these criminals out  and if you don't take them out and they're in new mexico  i got to tell you something  folks  you got problems  you got problems  you've got big problems  republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans  not for criminal aliens  and republicans will always support the heroes of ice  border patrol and our great law enforcement  the democrat party窶ｦ do you notice i always say the democrat party  you know  before i came  they were all calling it democratic because it sounds better  right  it does  it's much nicer  the democratic party is much nicer than the democrat party  but their name is the democrat party  and i'm not looking for them to sound nice  i want to give their name  so  i always say the democrat party  but that's their name  the democrat party  frankly  they should probably change it because it does窶ｦ and then i'd call them the democratic party  but the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream  every major窶ｦ that's a nasty fly  i don't like those suckers  i don't know about you in new mexico  but i'm not into flies or mosquitoes  i don't like snakes too much  we have plenty of them in new york and washington  a different variety  i don't like snakes either  we got a lot of snakes in washington dc  we got a lot of steaks in new york  i don't like either kind of snake  i think i like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in washington  every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed medicare as we know it today  my administration will protect medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  the republicans will always do that  our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years  you don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it  sometimes i'll have a news conference about something that's so good and i'll say  you know窶ｦ i'll call my wife  first lady  first lady  people love our first lady  i'll say  ""wait until you see television tonight  and we did something that was so great "" whatever it may be  we did a lot of things  we did something so great and it won't be on  but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative  that's what they like best  take something good and turn it negative  it's breaking窶ｦ we have breaking news  we have breaking news  these are phony people  but that's okay  you know  when you think of it  i'm president and they're not  crazy  it's crazy  you know  sometimes i'll be in the oval office and i'll be with my people  we have great people  and i'll say  ""you know "" and it's great comm in the oval office  you don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much  that's not what they窶ｦ but we have great comm considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world  right  but i'll be saying  ""you know  they don't treat us right  they don't treat us right  it's not fair  it's not this "" and then i'll just sit back  i'll say  ""but we're in the oval office and they're not  it's pretty amazing  it's pretty amazing "" and when you have the democrat party and the press  the media  the lame stream media  the fake news  and they're partners窶ｦ they are partners  okay  remember the word ""manufactured "" they used the word manufacturer on something  never been used for that thing  and every news gets ""the manufactured crisis started "" the next one  ""this crisis was manufactured "" every one of them used the word ""manufactured "" they know what i'm talking about now  now  that's called collusion  folks  that's real collusion  you have that  and so you have the democrats  you have the media  their partners  then you have the deep state  we're getting rid of a lot of them  i'll tell you  we're finding them left and right  boom  you take a look at what窶ｦ i'll tell you what  i'll tell you what  you take a look at what we're doing with all of the things  i'm not going to get into detail  but you know what i'm talking about  clean the swamp  that's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp  and then i hate to say this  but we have some republicans  they're not good  you call them a rhino  they're rhinos  the rhinos are worse  and some of them are worse than the obama people  right  they're worse than the obama people  they're worse than the clinton people  but there aren't too many of them left  they're pretty much on respirators  they're gasping  they're gasping for air  but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe  i didn't hear you  why did you say why  what  i didn't hear that  virtually  every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth  and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  it's true  right  i see it  just like mom  i see it  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  and socialism  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and it is the party of the american dream  we've achieved record funding for the us military  all of that money  trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old usa  and i have to tell you  new mexico  i know you're going to like this  a lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion  all of a sudden you're in trillions and i can save a lot of lines when i just say trillions  a lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at holloman air force base  white sands missile range  kirkland air force base and many other vital new mexico military installations that are going up as we speak  that's also jobs  but more importantly than even jobs  incredible  what you've done for the military  new mexico  is incredible and we've remembered  but we're pouring a lot of money into new mexico and that means a lot of good things  and we're investing in our nation's nuclear security  including right here in new mexico and sandia national laboratories and los alamos national laboratory  to protect american security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal  it was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the iranian regime  watch how that works out  folks  that'll be very good  i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and don't forget what i did for israel with respect to golan heights  don't forget  right  for years  you watched as your politicians apologize for america  now  you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for new mexico  and you must never forget  get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody  we need it because we're fighting a lot of forces  including facebook  i saw  and google  i saw  did you see google  he said i may have lost two-million to 10-million votes  according to this character that worked at google  right  and we still won  how the hell did we win  everybody was against us  how did we win  how did we win  this is a google executive  from two-million to 10 5-million votes  and we won  i don't know  we must be doing窶ｦ i will say this  that happened and people came from the valleys  they came from everywhere  they came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women  but the truth is i know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country  they really are  they just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time  they didn't want to get out there  they said  ""oh  boy  oh  boy  is this the best they can do "" i mean  in all fairness  i don't want to go too early here  look at the field  did you watch the debate the other day  we've got almost 350-million people  i'll take it  that's the best they can do  we'll see  we'll see  you never want to get too cocky  somebody said in the great state of texas  ""donald trump is down two points to buttigieg "" buttigieg  buttigieg  they're phony polls  you know they have phony polls  i told this story the other night  for six months  i was hearing that i'm going to lose the state of texas and friends of mine from texas that look just like these guys  see these two guys with the hates  they might even be better looking  they look just like窶ｦ and they want to say  ""i don't know about you  but i know a lot about texas and donald trump is not going to be losing the state of texas "" remember that  see  they don't say it's in play  they're too smart  they say texas is in play  and utah  they said was it play  all these are in play and play means we could lose them  right  it's a better term though because this way  they can't get skunked  but they can get skunked with me  so  what happens is on that beautiful election窶ｦ was that one of the greatest  coolest nights ever  well  they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot  this is six months  ""texas is in play  you know  he could lose texas "" i keep saying  i go to a stadium  we sell out to thousands of people  lines that are miles long  i mean  and every friend of mine says  ""you're going to win by a lot "" 00  whatever time  ""the polls in texas are closed  donald trump has won this state of texas  the polls in utah are closed  donald trump has won the state of utah "" they don't even take a breath  now  if it's close like it's in play  you wait two  three  four or five hours to see what it is  but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see  they're no different  they're suppression polls  and i'll tell you what  we're going to win the state of new mexico and i'll be so surprised if we don't  i'll be so surprised  no  we're going to win new mexico  you know  when i came here during the last election  came here a little because i was told very hard to win and i came here a little  but i saw great spirit  but i didn't really have a track record because i never did this stuff before  so  i said i was going to cut your taxes  i did  i said i was going to cut your regulations  i did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years  i've been there for two and a half  and i think the regulation cutting窶ｦ like the waters of the us  that was another beauty where you couldn't build a house  you couldn't farm your land  now  what we've done on regulations is incredible  i've done窶ｦ i've rebuilt our military  i've taken care of our vets  look how happy our vets are with choice  instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days  they now go out  if there's a wait  they go out  they get a private doctor  they get taken care of  we pay the bill  and for the first time  they've tried to get that for 45 years  they haven't been able to get it  but i'm good at getting things  you must never forget  the 2020 election is about one thing  what's it about  it's about you  it is  it's about you  it's about you  i'm doing a good job as your messenger  but basically i'm a messenger  i know what you want  i understand that it's about your family  it's about your future  and it's about the fate of your country for your children  for everybody  it's about the fate of your country  it's about the future of our great country  no matter what label they use  a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream  that's what it's about  look at venezuela  venezuela  15 years ago  was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today  very sad  no food  no water  no nothing  socialism  we begin this campaign with the best record  the best results  the best agenda  and the only positive vision for america  and it's not just a little bit positive  our country is going to be greater than it ever was  that's where we're headed  together  we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work  the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done  with your help  we will elect a republican congress to create a safe  modern  fair  and very lawful system of immigration  and we're going to have a lot done anyway  we already do have a lot done  you saw the figures last week  but we're doing it the hard way  it would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen  we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful  beautiful words  that incredible phrase  ""made in the usa "" we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years  and we've already started that program  it will happen  we have the medicine  nobody even knew that  the aids epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years  we've already started the process  it's been funded  it's been funded  who would've thought that  honestly  when i ran  i didn't know that  we have now the technology and what they've done with respect to aids is incredible  what a terrible  terrible period of time the world went through  but we will have it ended within 10 years  we will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses  cars  healthcare  light bulbs  right  they took away our light bulb  i want an incandescent light  i want to look better  okay  i want to pay less money to look better  does that make sense  you pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that  with the new bulbs  if they break  it's considered a hazardous waste site  it's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container  give me a break  i asked the people  the professionals  ""well  what do people do when it breaks  because they break all the time  what do they do "" nothing  they throw it away  a lot of people didn't know  they didn't understand  you got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break  they really are dangerous  the gases come out  they're dangerous  these are the little things that i have to explain  otherwise  people will say  ""what the hell are you doing with light bulbs for "" and we're trying to do the same thing with cars  cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline  they have so much junk that they're less safe  so  what i want to do is the following  under our rules and regulations  the cars are environmentally terrific  but they're safer and they're  3 500 less to buy  right  and the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier  makes sense  right  they could be a little bit heavier  i mean  they make them now like paper mache  somebody touches them and the entire car collapses  when somebody hits me  i want to be in as close to an army tank as possible  no  they're made out of paper mache  they weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus  it's over  they say  ""what happened to that car "" no  i think of it  it's safer and it's less expensive by  3 500 on average  and california wants you to do the other cars and we don't  we're going to end up in a big litigation and i'm fighting for you  look  look  it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say  ""let them pay more  let it be unsafe "" they listen to the environmentalists  and i'm an environmentalist  i believe in the environment  i want the cleanest water on the planet  i want the cleanest air  i want a lot of things  you know  right now  we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country  but what are they going to do about china and india and russia and other countries that are spewing stuff  what are we doing about them  we're going to keep our nation clean  but you know  the universe is so big that when you talk about china  the usa  india  you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out  right  it's so big that it's right next to each other  it's right next to each other  does that make sense  right  it's right next to each other  so  what are they going to do  we want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air  we will defend privacy  we will defend free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and we will always defend your second amendment and we're doing it now  and above all  we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life  we believe that mothers and fathers  not washington bureaucrats  know best how to raise their strong  beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we will always live by the words of our national motto  nobody will ever take it down  nobody will ever take it down  we will never allow them to take it down  in god we trust  we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won't even be close  and we're right there  our ancestors crossed the oceans  settled a continent  tamed the wilderness  revolutionized industry  pioneered sciences  won two world wars  defeated fascism and communism  put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world  and every day of my presidency  we will never

25,21,Sep,2020,datasets/Ohio,"wow  that's a big crowd  this is a big crowd  thank you very much  everybody  hello to swanton and a load to toledo  i'm thrilled to be back in ohio with thousands of hardworking  loyal  great american patriots 窶ｦ days from now  can you believe it  43 days  we go to again win ohio  i understand from bob paduchik  you know bob  that we're going to win it by more than we did  whether we win at nine  we won by nine points  i just came into that big  beautiful place  it's got more televisions in any plane in history  they've got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor  on the ceilings  i just saw that we're tied in ohio  i don't think so 窶ｦ president trump may have a slim lead in ohio  they're not even campaigning in ohio  come to think of it  now  they're fake polls  they're almost as fake as the writers themselves  they're all fake  remember last time they said  ""no  he's going to lose ohio "" we won by nine points  so  we had seven swing states last time  president trump is going to go home early  but it wasn't president at that time  it was just donald trump  he will go home early  we did  that we went home early as victors  but we had nine states  they had one of the crazy papers  new york times  they hired that guy  they paid him millions because he never predicted wrong  he was wrong  i don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him  but they hired this guy  we had nine states  i was down at all of them on the day of election  i was going to lose all nine  and then guess what  i won every one of them  fake polls  they're fake polls  then we have a crowd like this  i don't know  look  the cameras  are you turning around  these guys are bad people  i swear  they never turn the cameras around  ever  turn them around  turn them around  they never tell  look at them  it's just like a bunch of stiffs  real stiffs  why don't you turn the cameras around for once  you look back there  you can't see it  there's got to be  feels like madison square garden on the ground except we have more people  oh boy  it's always tough  you know  we go through this all the time  we're always asking them  look at these crowds  i mean  as far  you can't see it  you have this prime territory  like you should be in the real estate business  now  as far as the eye can see back there  the cameras don't  they don't get it  you only hear it from the sound  i go home  i say to the first lady  ""did you see that crowd we had tonight in ohio "" she goes  ""no  no  they just keep it on your face "" that includes fox  they just keep it here  right here  they don't want to show  you know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them  it's positive for their ratings  it's really a good thing  but they don't want to do it  but i give up on it  you know what you do  you hear it because you can't have 窶ｦ you know when sleepy joe biden  he's got the circles  you knowthose big circles  you know why he has the circles  he's got four of them  because they can't 窶ｦ i mean  think of it  he is a guy who's failed every time he ran  we called him 1% joe and now he's shot and he got their nomination  how the hell does that work out  how does that work out  but he's got the circles  he got like four  sometimes he has six because that's a good way of saying  if you don't have any people  just put them in the circle and he's practicing the science  now it doesn't work out  but we're going to win four more years in the white house  we're doing things that nobody's ever done before  we're doing what nobody's ever done  and thank you for being here  i wish we could move the press back further  if you want to know the truth  as our nation mourns the loss of supreme court justice 窶ｦ thank you everybody  thank you  so is our nation mourns the loss of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg  i will soon announce a nominee for the united states supreme court  they say it's the most important thing a president can do  i don't know  i think military  maybe  we rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars  great  we will fill that seat  it's going to go quickly  probably announced the person  i don't want to make the men too angry  it will be a woman  is that okay  i don't want to have a problem with men  they'll say trump is doing very poorly with men  you listen  how's he doing  well  he's doing very poorly with men  with women  he's doing very poorly with the black community  hispanic community  then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma  without diploma  college  phds  what's he doing well  oh no  it's going to be a very short night  then they say donald trump is the projected winner by a lot  they say  well  what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men  diplomas  he did well with african american community  by the way  we are doing really well with the african american community  with the hispanic community  we're doing well with women  we're doing very well  we're doing well with suburbia  suburbia  i ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia  if biden got in  they will destroy the suburbia  we call it suburbia of the world and we love it  i know it well  westchester county  the suburban  they sometimes  if you say suburban housewife  you're in deep trouble  so what you do is you say suburban women  they love me  you know why  they want security and they don't want projects being right next to their house  that's okay  they don't want it  by the way  that includes minorities  because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities  that includes them  they don't want that  they want safe communities  they want great communities  they don't want to lose the american dream  it's very simple  i got rid of the regulation from obama- biden that was destroying suburbia  okay  destroying it  i think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in  you know who's in charge  you know who's in charge of the program  cory booker  cory booker  cory booker  so  i think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody  you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in  if i get in  you've got it  you've also got your second amendment if i get it  in 2018  we expanded the senate majority  remember  they said  first of all  i wasn't running  i wasn't running  it makes a difference  wait you see what happens  we're going to take back the house  we're going to get rid of this crazy nancy pelosi  kevin mccarthy's done a great job  we're going to take back the house  people are so tired of her  people are so tired  did you hear today  the latest  so  they impeached me for perfect phone call  perfect  it was a perfect phone call  now they want to impeach me again if i nominate somebody as i'm constitutionally obligated to do  to serve on the supreme court of the united states  go ahead and i want them to do that  i want them to do that  we will  we will  we will  if he puts forth a highly qualified candidate  we will impeach him  well  i said  ""well  i'm the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the supreme "" so  we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding  we're looking at five incredible jurists  five incredible people  women that are extraordinary in every way  i mean  honestly  it could be anyone  i mean  we're going to be announcing it on friday or saturday  again  they say it's the most important thing and think of it  so in a single term  single term  by the end of our term  we will have nominated and had confirmed i think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three supreme court justices  think of that  three  some presidents  they never get any  they last a long time  a lot of presidents get none  we've had three  it's blowing their minds  it's blowing their minds  but for the people of ohio  this is what you want  so  it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting  it's exciting even from me  i'm going to look forward to it  probably saturday  we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for  great respect  thank you  big stuff  that's a big thing  they set the course of our country for many years to come  whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things  they set the whole course of the country  very important position  the most important  joe biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review  if joe biden and the democrats take power  they will pack the supreme court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform american society far beyond recognition  they will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box  so  they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals  if he does something even towards left of center  which would be acceptable  i guess  we have no choice  if he did that  he would lose the left  so  he's going to have to put in radicals  so he doesn't want to show who his judges are  i've shown a list  i have a double list  about 45 from which i will only pick  but he doesn't want to do that  because if you found out who he was going to pick  he would be unelectable  hopefully  he's going to be unelectable anyway  we're going to find out  so  he wouldn't be able to survive a joe biden  you wouldn't be able to survive  we've been calling it socialism  i don't think it's socialism  i think it's a step beyond what they're talking about  you look at portland  you look at chicago  you look at new york  you look at baltimore and oakland  these are democrat run cities that are horrible in crime  there's no law and order  no cash bail  no anything  you know what  the republican cities are running great  they're running great  so  we're going to get it all changed around  we went into minneapolis  we solved the problem like you wouldn't believe  what did it take  you saw it  what did that take  i would say probably 30 minutes  right  they should have called us in about seven days earlier  how about the reporter  he gets up there  behind him is a burning city  i never saw anything like it  he's saying  ""there are really no protests here  this is very friendly "" we call this a friendly protester because you're not supposed to have political rallies  you're not supposed to have anything  the only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores  looting  doing what 窶ｦ that's okay  because that's protesting  but we'll call this a friendly protest  but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- 窶ｦ future the damage we'll endure for generations to come  we have to win  this is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion  and a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra  but we didn't think this was going to happen  but i used to say just a week ago  ""we're going to have one  two  three  four  and maybe even five  the next president  and the supreme court is going to be a tremendous factor "" a lot of people said that's the reason i won so easily in the electoral college last time  306  306 to 223  ""he will not get to 270 "" remember  ""he will not get to 270  this will be a short evening for donald trump  oh  good riddance  thank god we got rid of him  oh  this is going to be great "" and then that problem happened  ""ladies and gentlemen  donald trump has won the state of ohio "" remember the one  she was crying  she was crying  ""donald trump has won ohio "" but it wasn't winning ohio  it was by the margin  ""where the hell "" he said  ""where did this margin come from "" they opened the polls  then they closed the polls  normally you have to wait hours  unless it's a total runaway  and they said  ""ah  the polls and the doors are closed in ohio  donald trump has won "" and they go  ""oh my god  but wait a minute  he won by nine points  what the hell's going on over here "" then they said  ""donald trump has won the state of florida  donald trump has won the state of georgia  donald trump has won north carolina  south carolina "" remember that  was that the most exciting evening  really  remember  and it's not donald trump  it's you  it's all of us  they use the name donald trump  it's all of us have won  and this one's going to be even better because nobody has done  and then don't even challenge it  the fake news  nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done  we've rebuilt our military  two and a half trillion dollars  we've taken care of our vets  we have choice  we have accountability  we can fire people now when they're not treating our vets right  we couldn't do that before  they could treat our vets terribly  we have accountability  nobody has done what we've done for our vets  91% approval rating at the va  91%  the highest ever  so nobody's done it  and that's why i think this is going to be the most important of all  i used to say  ""well  i don't know  how does it compare to 2016 "" i just gave that up  this is the most important election  you know why  two reasons  number one  that's over with  the hell with it  the hell with it  but the truth is it's got a seat in  and we have a lot of new things including additional  substantial  middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts  and tremendous regulation cuts  and we're finishing up with our military  we're building space force  the wall is going incredibly  you remember the wall  they don't talk about the wall anymore  the fake news  once we started building it  if you think that was easy to build the wall  we had an entire party that would die for the fact  and i made a terrible mistake in the wall  instead of telling you  ""we're going to build a wall  we're going to build a wall "" the democrats formed  it was very tough  but i got it  i'm a real estate developer  you can always get money  you learn we have a lot of little pockets  we had a lot of big pockets  but the military was great  the army corps of engineers were great  so we're up to 330 miles of wall  we're doing 10 miles a week  and we're going to be finished with the wall very soon  and it's exactly the wall  the little more expensive wall  they want like nice  expensive  but exactly what border patrol wanted  we're building them the exact wall that they want  we can't give them any excuses  we can't give them any excuses  but it's true  they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought i'd be able to get a bill  once i got it going  got it built  i got the financing  we won a lot of lawsuits  by the way  we won a lot of lawsuits  they sued us  pelosi was suing us  congress was suing us  the senate was suing us  we won a lot of lawsuits  once it was obvious that we won and we started building  they never talk about the wall anymore  and i made a terrible  terrible mistake because i had to work my ass off to get that thing built  you have no idea  you have no idea  you have no idea  but i should have said  the mistake  i should have said when i talked to these big crowds  and the crowds are getting bigger  there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago  but i should have said  instead of  ""we will build a wall "" i kept  ""we will build a wall "" place would go crazy  i should have said  ""we will not build the wall  under no circumstances  will we build a wall "" the democrats would have given us all the money we wanted  it's true  it's true  and then they would have said  ""see  he didn't keep his campaign promise "" these people are sick  the biden nominated justices will shred our second amendment  eliminate the right to self defense  and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms  you know that  put in other language  they will end your second amendment  and they will do that  by the way  if i wasn't here  you wouldn't have a second amendment right now  that would be gone  i hate to say it  i'm the only thing standing between you and chaos  i'm telling you  and second amendment and all of the other things  biden's justices will remove the words ""under god"" from the pledge of allegiance  did you see that  did you see it  they said  ""no  we'd never remove  and i saw it  they're doing the pledge of allegiance  and i said  ""oh  it must be a typo "" they left the words ""under god"" out of the pledge of allegiance  the democrats  and i said  ""oh  there's a typo  typo  they made a mistake  what a stupid mistake  can you believe it  that guy's in big trouble  what a stupid mistake "" and then i heard it a second time  they did the same mistake  that's what they're doing  they're going to take god out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of george washington  abraham lincoln  thomas jefferson  that's never happening  it's never happening  a lot of these democrats states  you see it  the churches are closed  they don't want our churches to open  you can have a riot where you kill people in the streets  25 000 people don't have to wear a mask  nothing  they can march down the streets  step on each other's face  they can do whatever the hell they want  that's okay  but you can't go to church  they have ideas  they have plans  and it's never happening with me as your president  that i can tell you  and you see it  they want to tear down crosses from public spaces  you see it  since i signed a little law  they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago  and i said  ""do we have any laws  like old laws when they was strong  when we were smart  when we were tough "" ""sir  we have one  sir "" a general came in  ""what's the law  general "" ""sir  there was a law from quite a while ago  10 years in prison "" they didn't use the word jail  prison  prison's a tougher word  i said  ""what do you mean  10 years "" ""you get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument "" i said  ""general  let me see that sucker  please  bring that to my office "" and we revived it because you can't get that approved by congress  they would never  today in congress  you'd do it  they'll give you half a day in a hotel someplace  so 10 years  so they were having a big march on washington in two days and i signed this new law  we updated it  and it was 10 years  you get 10 years in prison  you touch  you knock down a monument  and there's no games  this is the old days  this is the days when we had strong laws  when we had real laws  when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws  so here's the thing  so they weren't going to come in  they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named thomas jefferson  that's not too good  they had obliterated a lot of different things  and so i had a news conference  i announced that i'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail  and the police in washington  and we had national guard  we had secret service  we were all ready for them  we were ready for them  and the time came  there's was only a problem  nobody showed up  you know why  10 years was too much  10 years was too much  it's amazing the way  isn't it amazing the way it all works  so instead they burned down portland  i speak to the governor  the mayor is hopeless  he's a hopeless  poor guy  they chased him out of his apartment  and he still thinks they're wonderful people  they're burning down his city  but i want to go in there with the national guard so bad  it would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem  when they heard in seattle that we were going in  we were going in the next day  the guys just walked away  they left  that was the end of it  we had nothing to do  but they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion  biden's justices will erase national borders  they don't want borders  protect sanctuary cities  and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals  and if you look at some of these jihadist nations  no thank you  somebody said  ""that's not nice  that's not politically correct "" i said  ""that's okay "" they'll clip all the police departments  free violent criminals  shield foreign terrorists  and declare the death penalty unconstitutional  even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children  that's what they want  they don't want any death penalty  not for the boston bomber  not for anybody  you see the boston bomber  they're still trying this guy  what he did to so many lives  he killed people  ruined so many families  ruined so many lives  and by the way  they want the boston bomber to be able to vote  you know that  in three and a half years under my administration  we've secured america's borders  rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military  obliterated the isis caliphate 100%  fixed our disastrous trade deals  and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of ohio  i love ohio  i love ohio  i don't know what it is  i was told by bob and some of the congressmen that are here  we have some great ones  i'm going to introduce them in a second  but i was told that they're not even trying for ohio  you know why  because i love you and you love me  and that's the way it is  that's the way it is  thank you  i love you too  it's very interesting  so somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on  they have too about the seat and all that  but there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies  we're having massive rallies  we're in minnesota  we had a tremendous crowd  wisconsin  tremendous  pennsylvania  every one of them  i mean  in all fairness  it's like this  everyone  but this rant is going on like it's crazy  and it's  ""we love you  we love you  we love you "" and you know what  i don't want to say it  i'm just saying  they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation  even we loved ronald reagan  but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said  ""we love you "" about  i guess i have to call myself a politician  i don't feel like a politician  how nice is that  i never heard it  i've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies  i've never heard crowds go  ""we love you "" but you know why  we love you  i love you  but you know why  because  again  nobody has done what we've done  ohio had the best year in its history last year  we had a great year  and next year  assuming we win  which i hope we're going to win  but if we win  you're going to have a year next year  first of all  take a look at the third quarter  it's going to be announced the numbers just before the election  they'll come out three days before the election  and i'll tell you what  i'll bet on the numbers  even though crazy nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus  they don't want to give anything  they want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can  you know what they're going to do  they're going to announce they're going to be opening on november 4th  there'll be open  all these closed states  they're going to be open on november 4th  one of them blue and a teacher's union  did you see it  ""no  we don't want to open now  we don't want to open  the pandemic  we don't want to "" we're rounding the turn on the pandemic  vaccines are coming soon  ""but we don't want to open  around november 4th we're going to open "" this person that's a judge of a union said that  that was not good  i think they'll get rid of her quickly  i'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the big 10 and the ohio state buckeyes  you better have a good year after all of that  you have a good team  right  good coach  good team  good everything  you have a good team  you always have a good team  but there was a case  what do i know  i said  ""how's it going  everything good  are you struggling "" they said  ""sir  sleepy joe biden did an ad that you "" me  ""that you closed football "" i said  ""what do you mean i closed  i didn't close "" the guy did an ad  it's called disinformation  it's called the opposite of what the fact is  not only didn't i close it  i didn't think about it too much  okay  the states should all be open  but i heard about big 10 football  and because of this ad  i said  ""hey  wait a minute  i have an idea "" it was a fake ad  just like the ad on the grave sites  and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent  he has no idea  because now  see  i would never talk like that  but when i saw that horrible thing  and nobody's done more for the military than i have  when i saw that horrible ad  ""an anonymous source has said that donald trump said this "" i have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie  they don't care  so they did an ad  once they did that  i said  ""well  now the gloves are off "" let's face it  joe biden is incompetent  he always was even in prime time  he was incompetent in prime time  and now he's really incompetent  but because of the ad  i said  ""it's very interesting  that ad  it's very interesting  let me call up the commissioner "" i had called up the commissioner  very good guy  and i said  ""commissioner  what can we do to get big 10 football back "" ""well  i don't know "" and we started a little thing  the commissioner and myself  one of my guys  he's fantastic  and within a few days  it started getting talked about  and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world  we get no credit for it  we've tested almost 100 million people  india is second with 38th and they have 1 5 billion people  slightly more than you  but i will tell you  so all of a sudden they have schools  then looked like it was going to open without michigan and without a couple of states  and then all of a sudden the pressure became so great  and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting  and i will tell you  it's not a question of taking credit  but truly we were the ones that did that  i mean  it was  i'll tell you when i do it and when i don't  but it was closed  it was gone  it was announced that it was closed  and what really spurred me on was when sleepy joe announced that i was the one that did it  i said  ""i didn't even know it was closed "" but once i found out it was  i called the commissioner  he was really good  i tell you  and we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going  it looked like we had seven schools  eight schools  all of a sudden  everybody fell into line  i think they're all open now  every one of them is participating  so i want to thank the commissioner  i want to thank all of those schools  may the best team win  in other words  ohio state  that's a good team  you know who the best proponents were  the players and especially the parents of the players  these kids have a short window to get into the nfl to create some excitement and how good they are  and you have a lot of potential players  but they couldn't play football  and they said  ""we're safer on the field than we are staying at home "" and they meant it  and we did something and i'm happy about it  so enjoy the football  enjoy it  under 16 years of presidents obama and bush  median household income rose only  2 945  so remember that  that's 16 years  2009  so let's say 3000  under three years of president trump  it rose almost  7 000  so think of that  16 years  three years  achieving the highest median income in the history of our country  in my first three years  we lifted 6 6 million people out of poverty  the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country  we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again  we're building it again  i see the signs ""make america great again "" so i say this  it's called now ""make america great again  again""  because we did it and then we had to close it up  we saved millions of lives  if we didn't do that  you would have had three million people  it would have been terrible  it's terrible anyway  they shouldn't have allowed it to happen  china  to defeat the china virus  we launched the largest mobilization since world war two  through pioneering therapies  we reduced the fatality rate- through pioneering therapies  we reduced the fatality rate 85% since april  think of that  that's remdesivir and all of the things  the plasma  all different things  where do you see what's coming out  europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the united states  that's before today's big breakout  you know they had a big breakout in europe and they keep saying in the fake news  they keep saying about  ""oh  europe  europe  europe "" well  we're doing better than europe  i hate to see what happened  and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing  but they had a big hit and they'll take care of it  they know how to do it  they'll take care of it  we're working very closely with europe and other countries  including on the vaccine  we have three vaccines right now that are right there  they're right at the starting gate and they're going to be fantastic  so it's good  with biden  if you had that regime  you'd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the fda  what we've done in a very safe manner is amazing  now remember this  biden was in charge of the swine flu  right  it's called the h1n1  remember he calls it the n1h1  i said  ""no  no  no  no "" h comes before the n  it's so easy  but he goes  ""the n1h1 "" we say  ""no "" but it's the swine flu  maybe we just call it the swine flu  he did such a gross  horrible job on that  his own man who was in charge of it said they didn't have a clue  they didn't know what they were doing  it was a much less lethal disease and they lost many  many people  many  many people  it was totally incompetently  and now i got this guy standing up  well  we're giving him advice  his own guy that ran it  did everybody see this  they're saying they didn't have a clue what they were doing  it was so bad  i don't know why the hell he said it  to be honest with you  who would say that  maybe because he was honest  does that make sense  now biden gets up and he's saying to do the same things as we've already done  he basically took our plan and he said  ""this is what you should do "" but we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any western nation by far  our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs  including 1 9 million jobs in the state of ohio  you know that  he knows it  he's got one of them  he's got one of them  through operation warp speed  we're developing these great vaccines  and that's going to be窶ｦ literally  these will be done in record time  like nobody's ever done it before  on november 3rd  ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy joe biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine  shut down the country  he actually suggested that he would shut down the country  we now know the disease  we didn't know it  now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems  if they have other problems  that's what it really affects  that's it  you know  in some states  thousands of people  nobody young below the age of 18  like nobody  they have a strong immune system  who knows  take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system  but it affects virtually nobody  it's an amazing thing  by the way  open your schools  everybody open your schools  sleepy joe biden wants to impose a  4 trillion tax site  ban american energy  destroy the suburbs  give free healthcare to illegal aliens  how about that one  you know the bad part about that  we all have heart  we want to take care of people  probably that is everybody's going to come to the united states  people that weren't even thinking about it  they're going to say  ""oh man  these idiots are giving free healthcare  free college education  they're giving free everything  they're giving a rolls royce to every family that enters through the southern border "" remember i said that jokingly and cnn said  ""he misrepresented  they are not getting a rolls royce "" i agree  now they're sick  they are sick  and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies  they're doing that  we're stopping it  to combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools  i announced last week that we're launching a pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission  we will teach our children the truth about america  that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time  we got to  no party can lead america that will not teach our children to love america  biden's running mate  kamilla  who likes kamilla  does anybody like her  she was the most failed candidate  i mean  she started off good  and every week she went down  down 15 points  12 points  11 points  9 points  six points  five points  four points  two points  didn't she leave at about two or one  she was heading down to the basement  she was so mean to him  i felt sorry for him  no  i did  i felt sorry  so she called them everything from a racist to a metooer  he was metoo  he was a part of the metoo generation  what she called him  what she said  so i brilliantly said  ""well  he can't pick pocahontas because she was too nasty  how nasty was she to bloomberg  was she unbelievable  boy  he was standing there  what happened  what happened  no  actually  what happened  mini mike  he's another beauty  he's a real beauty  mini mike  what happened  what the hell happened  he hit her so hard  remember  she hits him with about 30 different things  and i'm not talking about our president  he thought she was talking about me  can you believe it  and i'm not talking  i'm talking about you  he said  ""get me out of here  get me out of here "" and now he wants to buy his way back into the democrat party  he wants to buy his way back into the democrats  he hasn't taken enough abuse  if i were him  i'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good trump economy and get even richer  biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail  you saw that  including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child  now they're trying to free them on bail  they're putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist  and that's what it is  my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist  and that's what we're doing for many people in jail  many people  remember what i told you about the monuments  this is remembrance  isn't it beautiful  we don't see that anymore  have you seen a monument knocked down recently  no  we don't see it anymore  i don't know  we want to rip down abraham lincoln  it got to lincoln  first  it was not too many people heard of him  confederate soldiers  et cetera  you say  ""hey  look  do it through a process "" but they started hitting lincoln  then they hit gandhi  now gandhi was about peace  gandhi just wanted peace  leave me alone  peace  peace  peace  let's rip them down  they're sick people  the democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in democrat control cities costing countless black lives  if biden and the left gain power  they will dismantle police departments nationwide  i'll tell you  the community that's most hurt  most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community  the hispanic community  and we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the hispanic community  and the asian community  we're doing great  in fact  we did so well last night on one poll  they said it must be a typo  they did  it must be an error  it wasn't  it's no error  you're going to find out on november 3rd it's no error  as president  i always stand and i will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement  they're great people  they're very brave people  not easy  and they don't get support  we have to give them back their dignity  we have to let them do their job  that's very simple  they're great  we're joined tonight by two high school football players  they became very  very famous

we are  i think we are  a friend of mine that i'll tell you  this is the greatest optimist  when i thought we had to be down  we lost a lot of the top  top support  the head of the republican party  little things like that  i said  ""we don't have a head of the republican party  he left because you had a terrible governor in this state "" terrible  your previous governor was terrible  he was terrible  i'll tell you  i got this man  i didn't know him  within about a week  i said  ""man  this guy's a big optimist "" and he was right  he called it right to the thing  he ran my campaign  when he came back for the second time  we had him in a high position  i said  ""bob  i think you're great  you're doing a great job  i want you back in ohio  we have to do it again "" bob paduchik  where's bob  thank you  thank you  bob  get over here  bob  thank you  bob  he wants no glamor  he wants no glory  he just wants to win  he called it right down to the bone  we had a rough couple of days  i said  ""bob  how we doing "" ""you went up two points "" i said  ""you got to be kidding "" but we did  so much evolves around ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with  it's a great state  we've done a great job for you and you've done a great job for us  so we appreciate it very much  thank you  together  we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the democrats and joe biden over a 47 year period  think of it  he's always talking about  ""you should have done this  you should have done that "" he really just left office  it's not that long ago  right  he's been there for years and years and now he should have done  he's never going to do anything  he's never going to do anything  guy is a stone cold loser  biden supported every globalist sellout of ohio workers for over a half a century  including nafta  china's entry into the world trade organization  the disaster known as tpp and how about the paris climate accord  that's another beauty  i'll tell you  that was designed to hurt our country  you would have lost trillions of dollars  closed your factories all over the place  in the meantime  china didn't kick in for another 10 years  the whole thing was a rigged deal  i tell you  i said  ""i'm going to get killed for this one  but we're going to terminate "" and you know what  the people got it right away  everybody understood  that was another rip off of our country  this state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the nafta and china disasters  joe biden is a shameless phony who pretends窶ｦ he doesn't have a clue  what the hell  we're talking like he knows  he's got guys around him that are pretty smart  they're radical left  he's going to do whatever they tell him to do  he pretends to care about blue collar workers  after spending more than five decades in washington  he tells me  ""why didn't you do this  why didn't you do that "" you see these fake commercials  ""why didn't you do it "" i said  ""i've only been here three and a half years  this guy has been here for 47 years  he didn't do anything "" my actions saved countless jobs across ohio and here in toledo  the home of the jeep  right  the home of the jeep  that's good  that's a great brand  they've done a great job with jeep  jeep  everyone loves jeep  earlier this year  i kept my promise to ohio when we ended the nafta nightmare  i proudly signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement in july  that's a big difference  like day and night  it's working out great too  it's working out great  you know how i know that it's a good deal for us  because they don't like it  i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of ohio jobs  we achieved american energy  we passed record tax cuts and regulations  our energy independence is incredible  we have now energy independence  we don't have to be in these far away lands anymore  now we'll be there to help certain allies that have been great  but we don't have to be  since my election  natural gas production in ohio has surged 63%  they want to close it up  by the way  you do know they want to close it up  they want to close up all fracking natural gas ever  they want to close it up  this would kill at least 700 000 ohio jobs  probably more than a million  while i'm president  america will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and ohio workers will continue leading the way  i just left the great state of texas  and i talked to a lot of people like this  a great crowd of people  we have tremendous support all over the country  i'll tell you what  these people are great  and here's the platform that they have  sleepy joe biden  no oil  no religion  no god  and no guns  now i'm in texas  it's a really rough thing in ohio  but now we're talking texas  no oil  that doesn't work well in texas  right  no guns  that doesn't work well in texas  no god  look what they're doing to the churches and everything  that doesn't work  no god  no religion  that doesn't work well  you would have to be george washington with your running mate would be abraham lincoln  okay  your vp candidate  and you'd still lose very big  and then they say- 窶ｦ and you'd still lose very big  and then they say  ""yeah  he's doing okay  he's two up in texas "" they said it last time too  that texas is even  four years ago  and everybody said  ""no  i think trump is killing it "" we'd have stadiums with 25 000  30 000 people  much more that couldn't get in  we'd have 40 000  50 000 people outside and they'd say i was even  we won in a landslide  just like we won this state  in a landslide  you know the expression they use  ""texas is in play "" you know what ""in play"" means  it could go either way  and guys would get on there and say  ""i don't think so "" and then that night again  ""the polls in texas have closed  donald trump has won the great state of texas "" i mean  the whole thing is crazy  it's crazy  it's crazy  you know what they do  it's suppression polls  they try and depress you  they try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife  your husband  you go out to dinner  ""darling  let's have dinner  it's so sad  we love donald  but he just can't make it  he can't make it  let's go out  have dinner  we'll come home and watch the results "" except 2016 came and nobody did that  they all went out and voted and we kicked ass  tell me  was that the most exciting evening in the history of television  did you ever see the ratings  the combined ratings  i think the biggest ever  but was that the most exciting  2016  was that the most exciting evening in the history of television  we invested  2 5 trillion in the u s  military  including more than  6 billion in contracts  i'll tell you what  you like the word pronounced lima or lima  because i saved lima  and i tell you what  i saved lima  i came here and they were going to close that plant in lima  they were going to close the tank plant  it was done  and i said  ""why are we closing a tank plant "" and i got a couple of calls from my friends  the congressman right here  and i got calls  and jim jordan called me  do you like jim jordan  he's great  and i looked at this army tank plant in lima  i said  ""why are we closing it "" and i saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible  and if you ever closed it  you'd never be able to open a thing like that again  so i overrode the generals  i overrode everybody  and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving  but we had tremendous success  we took 100% of the isis caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many other people  qasem soleimani is dead  he's dead  i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  they paid  150 billion  plus  1 8 billion in cash  you know they got  nothing  they got nothing  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  every president for many  many decades said they were going to do it  they never did it  they never did it  they didn't have the guts to do it  they campaigned on it  they were all going to do it  then they got there  there was a lot of pressure put on them  a lot of pressure put on me  every leader was calling all over  ""please don't do it  please don't do it  mr  president  please don't do it  don't do it  don't move it  just leave it the way it is  it's okay "" but i promised and i said  ""i'm going to do it "" and then i got calls from the biggest people in the world  kings  i got calls from presidents  from prime ministers  ""please  please don't tell it "" then i got calls  ""please have him call me back me "" me  i said  ""look  tell everybody i'm out for three days  i'm not going to be able to call them back "" i had a news conference  we announced it  then i called everybody back  ""hey  how you doing  how's everything going  everything going good "" ""yeah  well  i wanted to talk to you about israel  but it's too late  you already did it "" and we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done  and it's something we had to do  i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  and instead of endless wars  we are forging peace all over the middle east  and you saw that  and i'm the only man that got nominated for a nobel peace prize and i didn't get any press  they wouldn't  for two of them  last week  i'm not bragging about it  i'm just saying  i'm the president of the united states because of kosovo-serbia  they've been killing each other for years  i worked out a deal for them  i got nominated  and then israel with bahrain and uae  and many more to come  i mean  they all want to do it  we'll have peace in the middle east without blood all over the sand  no blood  we're going to have peace in the middle east  so i was nominated for the nobel peace prize  and i told this story last night  should i tell it or not  should i  yes  she wants me to do it  so i go home to our great first lady  i said  ""first lady  you're going to be so proud of me tonight  i was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people "" great people  ""first lady  i was nominated for the nobel peace prize "" i was like this  ""i was nominated "" it's a big deal for our country  right  and she said  ""oh  that's good "" i said  ""let's turn on the evening news  let's watch it  this is going to be a big show tonight  get ready "" and nbc  which is one of the most crooked  one of the worst newscasts  and i'm talking about normal nbc  not msdnc  msdnc is the worst  so i turned on nbc with lester holt  another beauty  and they start with a hurricane and then they went to something  and something else  and i'm saying  ""first lady  this is getting a little embarrassing  we're 20 minutes into a half hour show  they haven't mentioned the nobel peace prize "" and then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned  then i got nominated for a second one  they never mentioned  and when barack obama  barack hussein obama got nominated  now when barack hussein obama got nominated  he didn't know why he was nominated  it was like right at the very beginning  he didn't do anything  he did nothing and he got nominated  it was the biggest story i've ever seen  but that's okay  in the meantime  we're president and they're not  no  that's right  you would think if you nominated for the nobel prize  you'd get maybe half a second  the first lady  she said  ""sorry  darling  that's the way it goes  isn't it "" joe biden opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed killing soleimani  he voted for the iraq war disaster  he backed the disastrous iran nuclear deal  and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for our country  ""oh  it's really great "" if it were up to sleepy joe  bin laden and soleimani would be alive today  isis would be on a rampage  iran would control the middle east  and china would be the dominant power anywhere in the world  and i want to tell you  if you go back a few months before this pandemic  we were gaining  gaining  gaining  we had an insurmountable lead on china  i always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years  we were so far beyond  we were doing much better than they were  the biden agenda would obliterate our economy  he destroyed social security  destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions  that's what he's going to do  drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants  he would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by  listen to this  over 700%  and this is the manifesto with bernie sanders  with crazy bernie  he made this deal with crazy bernie  and by the way  a lot of the crazy bernie voters last time  four years ago  voted for trump because of trade  because the one thing they do understand  that our country has been off for years  biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools  very important to have them  in a second term  i will provide school choice to every parent in america  they're totally against it  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  and a limitless future for all americans  and just  in conclusion  first of all  it's been a great honor to be with you  this is  really  it's a great state  they're great people  i really mean it  no  i really mean it  get out there on november 3rd  we've got to win this one big  this is a bad  bad ideology  this is probably a step beyond socialism  i really think in many ways  it's communism we're talking about  this is a step beyond  socialism's no good  communism's really bad  but get out there on november 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us  so  in concluding  over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance  this ridiculous  crazy reliance on china  and all of these far away lands once and for all  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  we will hire more police  and by the way  thank you  police  thank you  law enforcement  increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech  and the

happening  nasa is again the leading space station anywhere in the world  there's nothing like a space center  what we've done  and there was grass growing in the runways when i took over three and a half years ago  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education  we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great

26,19,Feb,2020,datasets/Phoenix,"thank you very much  phoenix  we love to be back  we'll be back a lot  we're going to win that election  thank you very much  hello  phoenix  it's great being here in the great state of arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god  family  and country  thank you  thank you  and with your help this november  we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats and we are going to win arizona in a landslide  it's all over tv that the folks here tonight have helped a great world war ii veteran into the arena  i don't know if he knows it  but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world  i don't know what's going on here  he might even be hotter than trump right now  i have to say  did you see the scene  no  he's all over television  even fake news cnn him on  they say he's a legitimate great hero of world war ii  erwin julian  irvin  thank you  and i asked my son don to get a couple of hats and get some things  and give them to erwin right now  and i want to thank you  really  that's a great honor  and thank you for the great job you've done  an american patriot  thank you very much  thank you  don  how did don do tonight  okay  he's good  good guy  and he loves this country  so this is truly an incredible time for america  we have the best economy  the most prosperous country that we've ever had  and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far  do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the state of the union  you remember that  right  and that was my honor  but i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback  our country is stronger today than ever before  and after three years  of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan democrat crusades窶ｦ it was the radical left's pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots  poison our democracy  and overthrow our entire system of government  but guess what  they failed  and our poll numbers are higher today than they've ever been before  and we're standing up to the defense of our constitution  our freedom and democracy itself  we're doing something that's never been done in the history of our country  this movement has never taken place  nothing like it ever  and the fake news can attest to it  because if they thought i was saying the wrong thing  it'd be out there immediately  it'd be all over the place  it'd be all over the place  trump exaggerates  that's terrible what he says  there has never been a movement like this  and it began very early  it began in 2016 with that wonderful  beautiful night  you remember that  right  that beautiful night in november  and we're going to have another beautiful night in november  this time  it's going to be november 3rd  get ready  november 3rd  we're coming  we're coming  so we're having great polls  you're seeing the polls  except for some of the fake ones  and if i was treated fairly窶ｦ meaning  if you were treated fairly by the fake news  we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls  there wouldn't even be a competitive election  unfortunately  it's probably going to be competitive  but i actually think we're going to win by a lot  just like we did last time  but i really believe we'd be up 20 points  i mean  all they do is negative  negative  phony stuff  russia  russia  russia  the impeachment hoax  that's a hoax  but you know  we had great support from the republican party in the house  it was 197 to nothing  and in the senate  it was 52 and-a-half to a half  you know what the half was  a halfwit  and while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with the hoaxes  we've been killing terrorists  creating jobs  raising wages  enacting fair trade deals  securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race  color  religion and creed  by the way  they turned away 21 000 people outside  so feel very good  feel very good  we haven't had an empty seat  you know what  we haven't had窶ｦ true  we haven't had an empty seat  and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody's ever seen  but we haven't had an empty seat since your great窶ｦ and this is a great first lady  came down the escalator with me in trump tower a long time ago  we haven't had an empty seat  from our rural communities to our inner cities  we're expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens  we added another 225 000 new jobs last month alone  you saw that  the geniuses  you saw that  you saw that last month  they were doing predictions on one of the shows  what do you think  well  i think 60 000  what do you think  i think 100 000  what do you think  i think 84 000  these are the ones that tell you all about how to invest  what do you think  and then they came out 225 000  the market goes up again  225 000  225 000  so many manufacturing jobs  so many that frankly  we're never going to come back  remember  you need a magic wand  right  they came back  and remember this  we're paying interest  the past administration didn't pay interest  they pumped money in like it was candy  and we didn't pump money in  we took money out  and not that i was happy about that  because i disagree with it  because frankly  if we kept the old practice which frankly  some people could dispute one way or the other  we would have been up in my opinion  another 10 000 points in the dow  and we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years  144 records  144 records  record stock market  and you know what that means  that your 401ks are up 60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  guys come up to me  he said  ""mr  president  i just want to thank you  my wife used to look at me like i was a total loser  sir  every year we lost money for years and years  she said what the hell is wrong with you  henry  and this year sir  i'm up 92%  she loves to me again  she thinks i'm a genius "" 92% 401k  ""she thinks i'm a genius  sir  she loves me again "" shows what money can do  right  but that makes窶ｦ and think of this  seven million new jobs since we were elected  we were elected  and when i took over  isis was all over the place  and we immediately started  we have destroyed 100% of the isis caliphate  we have killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi is dead  and we just took out the world's top terrorist  qasem soleimani  ending his evil reign of terror forever  and the fake news doesn't want to tell you that  they don't want to tell you that  they don't want to tell you  in fact  do you remember the dog  great dog  conan  when we took out  right  we love conan  conan's a tough dog  but when we took out al-baghdadi  conan窶ｦ remember this  conan got more publicity than president trump  that's okay  they were looking for al-baghdadi for 16 years  we found him and we took him out  we killed another one last week  the head of al-qaeda  he was gone  dead  and america is respected again  respected like never before  we're respected again  we're no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country  including by the way  our allies  who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies  i will tell you that  they take big advantage  but not so much anymore  we're winning  we're winning like never before  washington democrats keep on losing their minds  they hate the fact that we're winning  we're winning big  we're winning  winning  winning  and that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement  they're joining our great republican party in droves  you see it all the time  i just spoke to some of your leaders  he said  ""this is unbelievable what's happening  this is unbelievable "" you know  there have never been rallies like that  sleepy joe biden the other day had 68 people  and now they have a new member of the crew  mini mike  mini mike  no boxes  we call him no boxes  and i hear he's getting pounded tonight  you know  he's in a debate  i hear they're pounding him  he spent  500 million so far  and i think he has 15 points  it just came out  hey fake news  how many points does he have right now  15  they won't tell you the truth  they won't tell you the truth  msdnc  msdnc is worse than cnn  they're owned by a company called comcast  you can have comcast  a bunch of phonies  but msdnc is worse than cnn  and they're all pretty bad  you know  they just came out with a poll  they just came out with a poll a little while ago  mini mike was at 15  and crazy bernie was at 31  that's a lot  and mini mike just spent  500 million  but the dnc is going to take it away from bernie again  that's okay  because we don't care who the hell it is  we're going to win  we're going to win  we have to  well let me tell you  these crooked politicians  they really took away three years from us  because despite the fact and nobody disputes it  that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything  we've done more than any administration in history  we've done more  but think of it  think of it  we did it with phony witch hunts  we did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time  we did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another president again  true  but with your energy and enthusiasm this november  we're going to take back the house  we're going to hold the senate  and we are going to keep the white house  so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best  greatest  i love them  leaders in america  arizona leaders

and a warrior senate  she helped us so much during the impeachment hoax  she didn't wobble one bit  martha mcsally  you know  martha's tough on the border  and she's working with me to strengthen our military still further  and lower your prescription drug prices  we're making a lot of progress  but her opponent  i have to say this martha  a guy named mark kelly  even the democrats don't like him much  he wants to raise your taxes  open your borders  give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants  and he wants to obliterate your second amendment  he wants to get rid of it  the radical liberal democrats from california and massachusetts  they're pouring money into kelly's campaign  because they know that he's a rubber stamp for crying chuck schumer  crying chuck  and nervous nancy wacko pelosi  and we're going to have a new speaker  but that's why martha has my complete and total support and endorsement  and we have to all get out there and make sure that martha mcsally窶ｦ she's a

 she's right  how about that congressman al green  we can't beat him  so we have to impeach him  how about that  that's not what our窶ｦ as they call them  the founders  how many times did you hear the name  the founders  that's not what the founders had in mind  but we're going to have a big  big election victory  we're working to- but we're going to have a big  big election victory  we're working together  i don't think the republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now  i really don't believe so  so whatever you can do for martha  we need her  it's been so incredible  thank you very much  thank you for everything  martha  i appreciate it  thank you  together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere  we're inclusive  this is the republican party  we're inclusive  right here in窶ｦ right  you know that  right here in america  right here in arizona  we've created 240 000 new jobs right here  including over 60 000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here  nobody thought it was possible  you've had the best year that you've ever had  arizona  you've had the best year  the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country  it's the best year you've ever had  so i'm going to take all the credit away from your governor  i don't care  no  we have a great team with doug and everybody else  but you've had the greatest year  you know that  doug  number one year in the history of your state  it's an incredible achievement  incredible achievement  i don't know  this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage  we'll talk about  ""well  you had the best窶ｦ in many states  the best year they've ever had "" then they said  ""let's get a new president "" i don't think that's going to work so easily  the country's had the best year it's ever had  let's get a new president  let's put in crazy bernie  let's go  crazy bernie  unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years  half a century  the average unemployment rate for my administration窶ｦ think of this  the average  so we're talking about now more than three years  is the lowest for any us president in recorded history  the unemployment rate among african americans  hispanic americans  and asian americans has reached record lows  lowest in history  african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country  african american and hispanic american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded  the unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years  soon to be historic  and veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low  we're working with our veterans  we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans  the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached the lowest level in history  workers without a high school diploma  you have a lot of them  they left high school  they said  ""i should have finished "" they left  they can't go back  they left  we've achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in us history  isn't that great  they're great numbers  hispanic americans right now  more than 500 000 own a home  more than 500 000 more own a home  and we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls  think of that  10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls  and happily  not that we did anything  they have jobs and they love them  they're making much more money and they love getting up and going for work  if they don't like that job  they can get another one  because people are starving to get great employees right now  they're starving to get great employees  since my election  the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%  three times faster than the increase for the top 1%  median income  think of this  this is such a big deal  median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country  under president bush  in eight years it went to  450 more  under president barack hussein obama  under a period of eight years  it went to  975  under president donald j  trump窶ｦ did you ever hear of him  in only three years  including regulation cuts and tax cuts窶ｦ because the other ones raise taxes  we cut taxes by the record amount  it went to  10  000 per family  a record  a record  that's why our consumer right now  our people  they're booming with cash  that's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better  china had the worst year in the last 67 years  asia's doing poorly  europe is doing poorly  the united states is doing great  we're doing the best we've ever done  the best we've ever done  to lift up forgotten communities that need investment  and these are really communities that need it the most  we created opportunity zones  we worked with tim scott  the great senator from south carolina  his idea  he came in and saw me  i said  ""let's give it a shot "" nothing's worked over the years  but this has really worked  now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated opportunity zones right here in arizona alone  from apache to navajo and maricopa counties  we're supporting working families by fighting pay  we are doing a job with paid family leave  we're doing something that nobody's ever done to this extent  reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of  2 200 in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit  our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and cutting through job  killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before  we've ended the war on american energy  lowering utility bills  reducing prices at the pump  and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers  for the first time  america is now energy independent  such beautiful words  energy independent  we fought wars  we did everything we could  we used to take the straits and everybody else benefited  we'd them clear so that other countries could take oil from the middle east with窶ｦ that nobody paid us  now they're starting to pay us a lot of money  folks  they took advantage of us  but we have everything we need right now  we have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines  the keystone pipeline  keystone xl  i approved it  the dakota access pipeline  i approved it  48 000 jobs  we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies  the worst trade deals any human being has ever seen  i said  ""who made these deals "" the worst  stupidest deals i've ever seen  they were good for other nations  if you like other nations  that's great  but we're now putting america first  it's very simple  for years  washington politicians took money from lobbyists  global corporations  and really  the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen  to ship our jobs and our factories to other countries  we lost our taxes  we lost our workers  we lost our companies  and we did nothing about it  now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in  america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta  the worst deal ever made  worst trade deal ever made  and one that was almost as bad and gave china an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the world trade  wto  one of the worst deals that we participated in this  by the way  we just won  7 5 billion in a lawsuit with wto  we weren't winning anything  we weren't winning anything  but they said  ""i think this guy's going to pull out "" they treated us so unfairly  we were always in the minority position  i mean  who the hell negotiated these deals  but they look at us and they say  ""look  if we're not treated fairly  we're gone "" all of a sudden  we're winning all these cases  but we just won 7 5 billion  7 5 billion  did you know that  doug  7 5 billion  but under this administration  the great betrayal is over  america's no longer for sale  america is no longer for sale  those days are over  two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace nafta  how many times have you heard we're going to replace nafta  probably the number one reason i ran for office  are we glad i ran for office  i think so  it's funny  i was watching the different窶ｦ i find it fascinating  i'm watching the different returns coming in and i'm watching as much as i can of this stuff  i love it  we all love it  if you don't love it  you're not going to do it very well  the crazy new york times  which was a dead newspaper when i ran  it was dead as a doornail  a month before i ran  doug  i held up a new york times  it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket  it was a thing  it just flew away  there was nothing  now it's doing very well  but you know what  someday we won't be here  when we're not  those papers are in big trouble  but this thing was a dead newspaper  but i was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing  they have mini mike has spent  411 million  it's a question mark  how's he going to窶ｦ i'll tell you how he's going to do  he's probably not going to get the democratic nomination  that's how he's going to do  but mini mike   411  then they had this idiot  steyer  we call him impeachment steyer  how did that work out  steyer  he's another beauty  the guy worked窶ｦ he spent 210 million  he got one-third of 1% in iowa  in new hampshire he did much better  he got less than 3%  guy's in there for like 250 million  how did it work out  steyer  you jerk  i never even heard of him  i never even heard of him  i turn on every time窶ｦ for years  i'm turning on窶ｦ impeach him  they don't even know why  they never say why  they don't have any reason  impeach the president  this guy spent a fortune on this stuff  so it worked out pretty good  but anyway  so then i go and i look  it has mini mike's窶ｦ question marks  i can give you the answer  but right now they have to have a question mark  right  then they go down and they had other people  some of them i like  they have ross perot  who honestly窶ｦ it was a tough day for bush when he joined the campaign  because clinton didn't win  ross perot took away 19% of the votes  didn't clinton get 41 or 43%  give me a break  but that's okay  whatever  but they had ross perot spent like 100 million  which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars  then they have different people  a friend of mine who ran  steve forbes  he ran twice  he was in for a lot  then they had donald trump  now  this is your own money  this is your own money  i said i'd spend a lot of money on my primaries  we'll see how the hell we do  it's amazing  once you win  money comes in  it comes in pretty fast  what's that all about  but so in the middle they had trump  and then they had four or five that were behind me  lot of money spent  loss  loss  loss  loss  loss  but in the middle they have donald trump  it didn't say 500 million  and it didn't say 250 like this steyer guy  it didn't say窶ｦ it said 70 million of my own money  i spent 70  it said  ""donald trump won the presidency of the united states "" right  we won  my father would teach me  if you could spend less and win  that's better than spending a lot and winning  crooked hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost  crooked as hell  she's crooked as hell  we have a double-sided justice  it's very unfair what's going on  very unfair  but let's see how it all works out  folks  let's see how it all works out  i hope you're going to be happy  i hope you're going to be happy  because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there  dishonest scum  dirty cops  a lot of dirty cops  by the way  the fbi  those guys in that are incredible  but the ones on top  they were absolute scum  what they were trying to do  if that happened to obama  or a democrat  or especially a liberal democrat  they'd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already  they spied on our campaign  remember that  after they spied  we won  then after we won  they tried to get us out of office  it's never happened before in the history of our country  and we can't let that happen  we can never ever excuse it  we can never let them get away with that  never let them get away with it  but we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great  the last month  we ended the nafta窶ｦ look  you saw it  nafta catastrophe  that's what it was  we ended that catastrophe  again  i really ran because of nafta  i said  ""how stupid "" all over the place  in your state  but you go to new england  empty factories  empty buildings  still you have empty buildings  we lost so much  we lost 60 000 factories and plants  i signed that brand new  beautiful us-mexico-canada agreement into law  the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers  and ranchers  and manufacturers all across the great state of arizona  by the way  for people with the small farms and small businesses  if you love your children  you can now leave your companies  you can leave your farm  you can leave your ranch to your children  and you don't have to to pay  they don't pay a death tax  they don't pay an inheritance tax  a big deal  that's a big deal  so if you love your children  it's good  if you don't love your children  it doesn't matter  don't leave it to them  if you don't love  if your children are no good to you  don't give them anything  let them go out and work like hell  no  if you love窶ｦ does anybody in this incredible audience窶ｦ man  this is a big building  does anybody not love their children  anybody  do i have a hand  do i have a窶ｦ there's a hand  you've got to be kidding  you've got to be kidding  so then you don't care about the tax  okay  don't worry about it  he says  ""no  i don't care about that one "" well  that's good  you look like a nice guy too  he's tough  you'd love to be his kid  wouldn't you  but i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs  our strategy worked  last month  we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defend our workers  protect our intellectual property  and boost american exports  china will invest  250 billion a year into the united states and buy our products and create jobs  nothing like that has ever happened before  after years of building up other countries  we are finally rebuilding our country  that's the way we want it  we are finally putting our country first  we are putting america first  on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than immigration  you know it almost better than anybody  anybody  doug  you know it better than anybody  what they've done on your border  but we're stopping that border  that border is clogged  and we've started the big wall right in arizona  we build a lot of wall  that's a big one  that's a big one  top of the line  before i came into office  the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country  poisoning our children  including  as you know very well right here in arizona  washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens  they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border  then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare  healthcare  everything  they want to give them everything  for a long period of time  they were treated窶ｦ you know this before i came  they were treated far better than our veterans were treated  now our veterans are treated great  true  illegal immigration costs arizona taxpayers more than  2 billion every year  two billion you're paying  nearly 20% of arizona's annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem  for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants  we could rebuild our cities all throughout america  which is what we should be doing  under my administration  we are finally taking care of our own citizens  including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws  pay their taxes  and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities  every day  democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives  in arizona alone last year  ice officers arrested over 4 500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery  rape  and murder  right here in phoenix  an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood  then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street  this savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison  he was in prison six years  he was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it  they want to protect them  last year in tucson  another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman  yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens  even convicted criminals  and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into america's communities  thankfully  arizona has banned sanctuary cities  with a republican majority in congress  we will ban them in every state in america  30 in the morning  i then went to california  made two speeches  i then went someplace else  i said  ""am i finished "" no  you've got to go to arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25 000 people  i said  ""that's okay  that's okay "" i said  ""that's okay "" no  i said  ""that's okay "" because i love this unbelievable energy in this crowd  but you know what  honestly  there's tremendous energy in our nation  there's tremendous energy in our nation  greatest nation in the world  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row  which will soon be a record  illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring  the month of january saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years  and we've ended catch and release  a horrible democrat policy that we got terminated  border patrol  great people  have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year  we've deported record numbers of gang members  including the worst gang of all  ms-13  thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country  we've done more to secure the border than any administration in history  we're building the wall  as i said  faster than ever  it will soon be almost one new mile a day  we're looking for that  washington democrats have never been more extreme  taking cues from crazy bernie sanders  how's he doing tonight  132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie's healthcare takeover of the world  think of this  180 million americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan  but if you don't mind  i'm not going to criticize it tonight  let them keep going and i'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election  okay  because i don't want him to change  please don't change  same with the green new deal  i don't want to talk about it  doug  tonight  i don't want to talk about it  i came up with the name pocahontas  too early  but fortunately  she's self-destructed anyway  did you ever see a phony like that  she's a phony  she lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage  she said she was an indian  i said  "" i have more indian blood in me than you have  and i have none "" she said  ""oh "" and she panicked  she panicked  and she had a test  you know the result  1/124th  i think i win the bet  somewhere along the line  i think i win  no  she窶ｦ i did it too early  i would have saved it  but i guess it was effective  she's essentially gone-zo  so窶ｦ one of those things  while the socialist democrats are try- 窶ｦ one of those things  while the socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare and your social security  my administration is protecting your social security  your medicare  and is fighting to give you great healthcare  and that's what we're getting  that's right  one of the big secrets  the democrats won't let us say it  they want to keep that as quiet as possible  look what they gave you  the worst healthcare  and what we've done  we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you  everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice  we're making healthcare better and much  much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office  we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were  and it's better healthcare  a lot of people don't know this  people don't know this  they think that's their issue  it's not  they failed on healthcare  we're protecting people with preexisting conditions  and we always will  and by the way  we're trying to get rid of obamacare  but we're managing it incredibly  but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions  remember that  we're trying to get rid of it  but while we're having it  we're managing it really much better than they did  remember they built the  5 billion website  remember that  it was supposed to cost  5 million  it cost  5 billion   5 billion  i mean  you could get a kid out of high school  i have a son  he's a young boy  13  he uses a computer  he could have given them a healthcare site  i would say he would have charged them  100  barron trump  and it would've worked  he's so good  ""hi dad  how you doing  dad  how's it going "" bing  bing  bong  i said  ""don't play with that while you're talking to me "" ""what's going on  dad "" these kids are incredible  right  the kids  they make us look like babies with that  but he could have given you a great site for about  2  they spent  5 billion on a site that never worked  by the way  speaking of that  how did they do with their vote count in iowa  and i hear  i hear  i don't want to say it  i don't want to jinx them because  of course  i want them to do well  but i do  we don't have anything  nobody's running against us in so many states  it's sort of nice  we can save the thunder  right  but i hear that in nevada  i'm hearing bad things about their vote count  i hear a lot of bad things are happening  like they don't know what the hell they're doing  i turned on the other night  iowa  i wanted to see 窶ｦ and by the way  we set a record in the history of iowa  we had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president  same thing in new hampshire  it's a good sign  it's a good sign  by a lot  by the way  by a lot  but i'm hearing that  and i hope this isn't the case because i'd like to find out who the hell won  we still don't know who won in iowa  i heard coming over here they're still working on the count  no  no  no  he said  ""you won "" yeah  i think we did win  i think we did  very good  that's very good  i have to thank you  that one  that's very good  no  we did win  look  we are winning  we're winning big  we have fake polls out there  these guys do fake polls  they are fake polls  i had a poll  it's just like it was in 2016  i'd hear these polls  i'd hear women didn't like me  and i did great with women  i hear everyone didn't like me  nobody liked me  nobody liked me  and then we won  thank you  women  nobody liked me 2016  no  no  i hear that  remember  women didn't like him  and at the end of that he did great with women  he did great with this  he did great with everybody  we did great with everybody  remember  306 to 223  that's a slaughter  that's a slaughter  remember  they said he cannot get  they used the word path  there is no path  right  to 270  i was at 269 if i did great  but they said there's no chance  but i was at 269  so i went to maine  i love maine  i went to maine  maine's cut in half  and one maine has one  i went there four or five times  people are great  i won it  and they were right  there is no path to 270  but there was a path to 306  these people  these people  there is no path  that's right  doug  they said there is no path  the fake news media  ""there is no path for donald trump "" and then they said the evening of the election  ""it's going to be a really short night for donald trump  thank god  we got rid of this guy "" because they did the exit polls going out  right  and i was even told  but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it  the highest number in history of people that said very nasty language  but i'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if i use it  so i won't use it  it's a much better story if i use it because that's the truth  that's what they said  ""how did you vote "" usually  they say  ""i voted for clinton "" or  ""i voted for trump "" right  ""how'd you vote "" ""none of your business "" see  i'm being nice  right  i'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening  they'll say  ""his language "" right  even this tough guy in the front says  ""i agree "" ""how did you vote "" ""no  i don't want to tell you "" ""how did you vote "" ""none of your damn business  i'm not going to tell you "" ""how did you vote "" ""i'm not 窶ｦ "" and it was like this massive number  right  massive  so everybody  they just didn't count that  so they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked hillary clinton  they're looking unbelievable  this is going to be a very short evening for donald trump  we finally will be rid of this guy  and then the numbers started coming in  the numbers started coming in  and it started with the great state of florida  donald trump has won the state of florida  and then that beautiful convention center  the most beautiful stage i've ever seen  and they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before  right  in fact  i went to the fireworks company  and i said  ""i'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks "" even though they were no way near where my area was  we were at a hotel in midtown  we liked the location better than where she chose  but they built the most 窶ｦ we remember that beautiful stage  it was shaped like the united states of america  and by the end  it didn't look too good  did you ever see more unhappy people  so they go  ""donald trump has won the great state of florida  they go  ""whoa  whoa  whoa "" they outspent me like five to one  only negative ads  they're all negative  so by the time people got into the voters booth  they only knew one thing  she hated donald trump  but they said  ""what the hell does she stand for  what does she do "" every ad was a negative ad  so it tells you negative ads  at least against me  aren't so good  they can be effective  but i think they spent like   2 billion on negative ads  everything was negative  so nobody knew what the hell she spent  you know  her husband said she was going to lose  her husband's a professional  her husband said  ""you better go to michigan because i was there and they got a trump/pence sign on every lawn i've ever seen  you better go to wisconsin  hillary  you better go to wisconsin "" she said  ""no  we haven't lost wisconsin in 36 years""  ""no  no  hillary  you got to go there  i'm telling you  i don't like what i saw "" ""no  what do you know "" he's a professional politician  she wasn't  it's one of those little problems in life  so then it came in  and then we won south carolina  we won north carolina  right  and we were leading pennsylvania by so much that if i lost  remember at 2% of the vote left  if i lost every single vote  i win by a lot  they refused  the fake news refused to call it  i kept saying  ""we won pennsylvania  why don't they call it "" it was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake  they're crooked  they are fake  and i said  ""why don't they call pennsylvania "" but some beautiful things happened  and by the way  ohio  we won by one of the largest margins ever  the great  great  great state of ohio  remember  remember  they used to say a year before the election  they said  ""well  nobody can win  nobody  unless you win the great state of ohio "" and we won the great state of ohio  and we won it big  we knew we were going to win it  and now we're up a lot more than we were up even then  because you know why  we're bringing back jobs  we're bringing back factories  everybody's working  nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having  and we've been doing it for a long time  right  almost from the beginning  and don't let them try and take credit  because if they came in  we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse  the d word  depression  we would have been  because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on  and i'll tell you  maybe bigger than even the tax cuts  and i did it sooner  were the regulation cuts  we freed up our nation to go back to work  true  so then we won wisconsin  and then we won michigan because those companies  now they're pouring back in  the auto companies are pouring back in  and wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that canada was taking  you know  canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products  okay  so what happens is this  we're working on healthcare  we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing  i just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices  those same prices fall very fast  we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs  which are just as good as the brand drugs  but they cost a tiny fraction  we've totally transformed veteran's healthcare  including getting long-sought va choice and va accountability  which they said could not be done  and we passed the spectacular right to try  so if you're in trouble  and i hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble  but if you're in trouble  you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors  best hospital  best labs  you get it  and the luck we are having  we are saving so many lives  it's incredible what's happening  people would go to europe  they'd go to asia  if they had no money  they'd go home and die  now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved  think of that  before they're approved  and we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic  drug overdose deaths  the overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years  and life expectancy is rising again in our nation  we've launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and alzheimer's disease  we're making tremendous progress  and we're pursuing new advances in neo-medical research  think of that  neonatal research  the numbers are incredible  what's happened is incredible  to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so  all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth  that is why in my state of the union  i asked congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  the democrat party is the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  socialism  blatant corruption  and the total destruction of your second amendment  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  the second amendment and the late great abraham lincoln  right  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background  every community  and every walk of life  we are the party of boundless optimism  excitement  energy  and enthusiasm  we have tremendous energy  tremendous energy  everybody says to me  ""where do you get the energy "" because i love what we're doing  i see the results  and they're happening faster than you even think  you see the numbers  they're happening faster than you would even think  we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement  we are the big tent  we are the big party  we are the party with big ideas for the future  republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school  right  right  to keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life  there's been nothing like this  i passed criminal justice reform  not the democrats  i did it with the republicans  and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the republican party  the democrats did not do it  they could never have done it   neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  we have invested  2 2 trillion to rebuild the united states military  including nearly  200 million for marine corps air station yuma  right  i recognized israel as the true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  we recognize israel sovereignty over the golan heights  they've been trying to get it for 52 years  and for years  you watched as your politicians apologized for america  you saw that  they apologized  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for the people of arizona  at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation  it is  this election is so important  it's the survival of our nation  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020  you're the forgotten people no more  right  no deplorables  right  no deplorables  who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster  but you know  she used the worst word  what was the word she used  irredeemables  right  i thought that was the problem  no  it was deplorable  so what the hell do i know about politics  she said  ""you're irredeemable and deplorable "" i said  ""oh  that irredeemable's terrible "" the next day people are showing up  women  ""i'm a deplorable "" only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp  which is vicious  horrible  ugly  and evil  much worse than i thought  but we're getting there and not pleasant  a bunch of really bad people  very dishonest people  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  from dependence to independence  and from poverty to prosperity  together  we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  we will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful  beautiful words and phrase  i love the phrase  made in the usa  made in the usa  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within now nine years  we started a year ago  can you imagine that  we're doing that  and it's going to happen  who would have thought we could have done that  we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on mars  we will defend privacy  free speech  and you know this  you know it's under siege  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  we will defend it  it's under siege  it's under siege  you see it in virginia  they want to take away the guns  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust  from tucson to tombstone  right  do you agree  you agree  right  look at him  he's agreeing  this guy  he's agreeing  no more censorship is right  no more evil  no more crimes  you're right  from yuma to mesa and from flagstaff to right here in phoenix  we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured their heart  sweat  and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom  arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors  great prospectors  cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness  braved the blazing sun  and it is hot here  i've been here during the summer  i want to tell you  it's seriously hot  of course  didn't they say that president clinton  when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf  it was 121 degrees that day  i don't know about that  i don't know about that  what do you think he was doing with the attorney general  i remember he said  ""oh  i just happened to see she was 窶ｦ i was here to play golf  it was 120 degrees out "" i don't know  a lot of crooked stuff went on  i wonder what they talked about  i'm sure it wasn't that she would become a supreme court justice  i'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as attorney general  she was a real beauty  i'm sure it wasn't  i'm sure it was nothing  they spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren  right  can't let it happen  folks  can't let it happen  we can't let it happen  you fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth  and we are making it greater every single day than ever before  great  great  great citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion and with your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  do you like winning  because not very long ago you weren't winning  and i don't want you 窶ｦ i told this a few times during the campaign  haven't used it in a long time  but i don't want you going to your great governor  he's a great governor  doug ducey  i don't want you going to your governor saying  ""governor  governor  we just can't stand winning so much  please go see the president in the oval office  governor  the people of arizona don't want to keep on winning  it's too much governor  it's not even fair to the rest of the planet  please tell him  governor ducey  please tell him  窶榔resident  the people of arizona have won too much  we don't want to keep on winning '"" and i'll look at doug ducey  and i'll say  ""doug  i've a lot of respect for you  doug  you won by 16 points  that means a lot  but doug  i don't care what you say  we're going to keep on winning  and we're going to win like never before  and the people of arizona are going to love it "" and he's going to say  ""thank you  mr  president  i'm going back home "" the fact is  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  and ladies and gentlemen of arizona  the best is yet to come  that's right  together  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america proud again  we will make america safe again  and we will make america great again  thank you very much  thank you  arizona

27,22,Sep,2020,datasets/Pittsburgh,"doesn't have the power  doesn't have the staying power  you see what's happening in california  blackouts  rolling blackouts  how would you like that in pennsylvania  the commonwealth of pennsylvania  darling  what's wrong  i can't watch trump on television  i can't watch our president  darling  we have a rolling blackout  it'll only be a few hours  i think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning  darling  and we can watch a rerun  now  this is what's happening  you have rolling blackouts  you have  in some cases  just blackouts  i don't even call them rolling  not going to happen to your state  last year  i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county  pennsylvania  the largest investment in your state's history  that was all made possible by our pro energy policies  we've done it a lot  in louisiana  we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen  largest in the world and it's incredible  all related to energy  but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril  because the radical left maniacs  they don't want to have anything to do with energy  they don't want anything to do with  they have different concepts  right  they have the green new deal  whether it will be no energy  almost of any kind  no  it's crazy  thought of by aoc plus three  you know aoc  and she's got them  she's radical left  but she's not as bad as some of them  how about omar of minnesota  we're going to win the state of minnesota because of her  they say  he's telling us how to run our country  how did you do where you came from  how is your country doing  she's going to tell us  she's telling us how to run our country  you know what  the democrats in congress  you have to see what they are doing  their stance on israel  it's like a whole different world  it's like from 10 years ago  it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be  we've got the greatest country on earth and we're going to keep it that way  we don't need socialist and we don't need communist telling us how to run our country  i do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste  i did it last night  we were 窶ｦ did you see the crowd we had last night  we were in a great place  ohio  we had a crowd  we had a crowd  you couldn't see the end of it  i said  ""turn around camera  turn around "" but  they never liked doing that  you know  they don't like spinning those cameras  they don't want to show the crowd  they don't like showing  they don't like showing  show the crowd and this is 窶ｦ it's an honor  let me tell you  look  i used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn  but then whenever there was like a problem  like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-trump person  you don't see that much  i don't want to bring it on  but you don't see it much anymore  you know why  it's dangerous  it's dangerous for them  but you know  i'd see the camera would never move  whenever where there's something like a little negative happening  that thing would turn around like a pretzel  i said  ""oh  it does move "" but  they never want to show the crowds  they never  last night  now  i went home and i tell you this  i go home all the time  first lady  ""how'd you like the crowd "" sir  i didn't see it  i didn't see it  but i didn't see it  donald  i didn't see it  sometimes she'll call me mr  president  but she's only kidding  believe me  she's only kidding  has she been a great first lady  right  she's been a great first lady and very popular  she's really done a great job  she works hard  we have some great people here tonight  i brought certain members of my family  but i'm going to introduce them to you in a little bit  okay  great family  they work hard  i'll tell you what  they work hard  they really work hard  but i do wish they would show because it would be  you know  it's actually better for them if they show  it shows the importance  the only thing you can do is show  i'll say  ""how did it look "" i don't know how it looked  but the sound was phenomenal  okay  it sounded like a penn state football game like the steelers football game  you can't disguise it  you ever see sleepy joe with the little circles  oh  you can  he puts them very far away  so far away  then he comes up with the mask  he's like a hundred yards from the nearest human being  he's got a 窶ｦ he feels good about the mask  i wonder in the debate it'll be him and i or the stage  is he going to walk in with a mask  no  i think he'll come in with a mask  i don't know  i have no idea  well  the question is  will he leave it on during the debate  because it's a little hard and i'm all for mask when you need them  i'm up  but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking  it makes him feel comfortable  honestly  whatever makes you feel good is okay with me  but it'll be interesting  i'm going to be  we're going to have a big rating on that  he's been doing it all his life  he's been doing it for 47 years and i've just started doing this stuff  i'm just starting  but  i'm just thinking  but i did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years  that's true  that's true  you look at what we've done  no  it's true  that's actually true  he did a lot of negative stuff too  you have to deduct that out  when asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels  including coal and fracking in a biden administration  joe replied  ""no  we would make sure that it's all eliminated "" all of a sudden  he gets the nomination  he's been trying to get the nomination for decades  he finally get  and that was prime time for him  which was never great  he never got more than 1%  we called it  remember  i called him his first nickname was 1% joe  frankly  had elizabeth warren been loyal to her philosophy  which is radical left  socialism  perhaps communism  i don't know  perhaps  it's verging on communism  right  but had she been loyal  she would've left  she would have quit  she had no chance  she was out  pocahontas  she was gone  remember  i said  "" i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none "" i'd love to have some  but i don't happen to have any  then she choked and she went out and got a test  she announced she had 1024th  right  1 000  that means  like i said it last night  that means around 700 or 800 years ago  somewhere  there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's okay  seven  800 years ago  maybe  what a phony she is  it's terrible  now  we're going to pick a great woman  any one of the five that i told you  but any one of the women that we had they're all great people  great scholars  great  brilliant people  a lot of people  00 on saturday at the white house  you see  we have tremendous republican support  two people  always got to be two  always got to be the two  those two  we have great support from the republican party  tremendous support  it's never been this unified before ever  ever and the fake impeachment  we had 196 to nothing republican support  we had 52 and a half to a half in the senate  who is the half  i can't imagine  i can't  buddy was very good today  i have to tell you  he was good  now  i'm happy  thank you  mitt  thank you  no  he was very good  very positive statement  but days ago  biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions  that's basically saying  you know what that is  there'll be no more oil  there'll be no more gas  there'll be no more nothing  there'll be no more industry  there'll be no more country  that's what it's like really  that would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas  sending your money to somebody else  not you  i'll keep your jobs in pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time  i can say the same because you are really big in energy  i can say the same thing to you as i say in texas  so  they don't want oil  they don't want fracking  right  they don't want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful  it's not going to do it  it's not going to do it  so  they don't like oil  they don't like the gas  they don't like god  religion  churches are close  how about these states  they still have churches closed  by the way  your governor hasn't been so great  you know that  right  are your churches still closed  they're still closed  they're doing it for a reason  by the way  november 4th  they'll announce  ""we've decided to open up "" okay  they're trying to make our numbers as bad as possible  so  california's closed  pennsylvania's closed  north carolina's closed  michigan is closed  that's another beauty right there  michigan's closed  then they have these fake ballots  millions and millions of ballots  by the way  when not if  when you see shenanigans  please report it to your authorities  okay  the real authorities  they're watching and the authorities are watching  but please report it  but when you look at it  really  it's amazing  they're trying to make our numbers look bad  but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order  right  law and order  the red states  the republican states  they're working great  record low crime  record low  but democrat run states  you look at chicago  you look at new york  new york has gone through a 窶ｦ we have to bring back  we should draft rudy giuliani  okay  let's bring him back  draft rudy  we want rudy  rudy  rudy  i'll tell you rudy is amazing  but he did a great job  new york was in big trouble  he came in and he just was tough  smart  and it became the safest big city  now  we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%  he fired 1 000  he fired a lot of police  i guess  a billion dollars a year worth of police  worth of great police  firemen and women  it's a terrible thing  i love that place so much and it's so sad to see what's happening to new york  we're going to make a little bit of a play for new york  in theory  the democrats automatically win new york  but i do phenomenally in most parts  then one part  it's automatic  but i can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy  so  we're going to make a play for new york  with pennsylvania  i don't have to make a play  we've got pennsylvania  just go out of here  we don't have to make a play  we don't have to  it's a great  you know  for years though pennsylvania was a place that republicans just didn't win  for many years  everybody thought they were going to win  every republican  so yeah  we're going to win pennsylvania  they thought they were going to win it and they didn't  i came along and we won it and we won it quite easily  quite easy  i think we're going to do even better now  because remember  number one in the history of your state last year  and that's because of what we did  we stopped the dumping  we saved your stell  so many different things  but pennsylvania is the home of american energy  think of it that way  this has taken place over a very short period of time  also  the birthplace of a thing called the american constitution  right  american constitution  to uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge  i will soon be announcing that nominee  you're going to love it  you're going to be so happy  if you don't love it  don't vote for me  okay  you don't like it  my opponent refuses to release a list of justices  i was told that a big thing when i was running last time  nobody really knew me  they knew me very well  we had great success at the apprentice and in business and it was great  but they never knew what kind of a judge i would pick or to be a justice  right  a justice of the supreme court  i said  ""i mean  what am i going to do  how am i going to solve that problem "" but  i was in politics  never  don't forget  when i ran  they said  ""no  he's inexperienced "" i ran against some very talented people  some of whom are very good friends of mine  some of whom i don't like too much  when i don't like somebody  it last for a long time  but i said  ""well  how do we solve that problem "" i don't know  they just weren't believing  the appointment of a- just weren't believing  the appointment of a united states supreme court justice was much more important to the voters than i thought  and they're right  because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy  whether it's life  whether it's second amendment  the second amendment  if i weren't president  you know the pressure  your second amendment would be obliterated  it would maybe be gone  but at a minimum obliterated  they haven't touched your second amendment  not even touched it  because i'm here to block  i'm a blocking force  i'm like a lineman for the pittsburgh steelers  i'm a blocking force  no  they haven't touched it  but your second amendment would be under siege  so nobody knew  i never knew  you hear about supreme court  you know about supreme court  you know about other judges  by the way at the end of the first term  we'll be close to 300 federal judges  including court of appeals  which i think is a record  i guess it's a record  it's a lot  that's a lot  nobody's done that  it's record  think of that  300  that's a big percentage of the entire judiciary  think of that  300  and many  many court of appeals judges  but two great supreme court judges or justices  and now we're going to get a third  can you imagine our enemies  three in one term  so many presidents  they just don't have the chance and it's so important  but i said to my people  i said  so if they don't believe me  what i'll do is i'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them  ""i will only pick from that list "" they said  ""that sounds like an interesting idea "" this was my idea  when you've never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination  so i got out a list  i named the people  the people are good  and i said  ""and i promise that i will pick someone like the people on this list "" and it didn't work  it went nowhere because they didn't trust it  they said  ""we want you to pick the people on the list  not somebody like the people on the list "" so i went back the next week  i said  ""i will pick somebody that's on this list "" and they were all great  great judges for the most part  i think almost entirely  but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country  solid  incredible people  and as soon as i did that  things went through the roof  it was amazing how important it was  by the way  would you stand up with that beautiful jacket  i love this guy  how many times- how many events  he's been to a couple  that's really great  thank you very much  i've seen him before  he's been here a couple of times  like about 90  thank you  man  that's really nice  i'm going to get one of those jackets  by the way  the wall  the wall  yeah  330 miles  330 miles  330 miles  and yes  we have a great relationship with mexico  first they said  ""he'll never be able to build it "" the democrats were just brutal  i made a terrible mistake  i said it last night  i should have said  ""we will not under any circumstances build a wall at our southern border "" they would have given me all the money in the world  but stupidly  i said  ""we will build a wall "" and the democrats said  ""let's not give it to him "" but we got it  we won  we won court cases  we won court cases  i won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted  so then they said  ""all right  all right "" they've lost  so by the way  we're up to 330  the exact wall  their dream choice  i said to the border patrol  i love these people  they're great  ice  the border patrol  what they do is incredible  they're incredible  i said  ""give me your dream wall  as long as we're building we might as well build a wall that you want  let's build it right "" ""sir  we have to have vision  we need steel and concrete "" i said  ""how about one or the other "" they said  ""no  sir  we need steel and concrete  we need steel  inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall  we need all sorts of things  we need them to be wired "" i won't tell you why they're wired  but they're wired for a reason  they're all wired up and they're incredible  but you know what  we got the wall  nobody could have done it  so once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles  200 miles  now we're at 330  and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon  and we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking  trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well  because that's a lot of the territory that we need  we're going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles  so we're at 330  but once they saw that i had it  they said  ""yeah  but mexico's not paying for it "" but they are paying for it  mexico's paying for the wall  they are paying for it  they're paying at the border  they're paying for the wall  all those trucks that go back and forth  they're paying for the wall  so the democrats said  ""yeah  but mexico窶ｦ""  they always have to find something  right  and do you remember what i used to say that if they fight us  remember people would say  ""what happens if they fight you on the wall  what happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall "" i said  ""the wall would get 10 feet taller "" took a little hit on that  we took a little bit of a hit  but that's okay  the wall is a tall sucker  you don't want to get up to the top  they look down  they say  ""oh  ye  ye  how do we get down off this "" it's tall and it's strong and it's great  and we appreciate  because mexico has been working with us very closely  they have right now 27 000 mexican soldiers on our southern border making sure that people don't come into our country  i want to thank the president of mexico  very helpful  so i made this list of potential justices and i'll tell you  it all changed  now i'm asking sleepy joe biden to give me a list and he doesn't want to do it  you know why  because he can only put super radical left judges on  people that would destroy our country  people that would destroy your country  and he knows that he's not electable窶ｦ he shouldn't be electable anyway  this is the worst candidate  you know where he is today  they have a thing called the lid  i don't even know  do you know what lid stands for  lid  he put out a lid today early in the morning  lid means he's not going to be anywhere today  i'm working my ass off  i'm in ohio  i'm in texas  i'm in florida  i'm in michigan  i'm in wisconsin  man  thank you  that's so nice  well  that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there  they said they've never heard of that one  ""there was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying  窶聾e love you '"" that's never happened to a politician before  am i a politician  i don't want to be a politician  i don't think of myself as a politician  but it really is  i appreciate it  i've never heard it  i liked ronald reagan  but they never said we love you  or maybe they did  they're going to try and find out  then they'll say  ""president trump lied last night because 40 years ago i remember窶ｦ"" but no  nobody's ever heard that one before and i appreciate it because it is reciprocal  thank you very much  reciprocal  reciprocal love  it's reciprocal  i had such a nice life before i did this  i had such a nice life  then i had the witch hunt that goes on forever  it goes on  and then we catch them spying on our campaign  how about that  let's see what happens though  but we caught them spying  all of that  the whole big deal  and then the guys that were doing the investigation  they have their 31 different phones  they were accidentally wiped clean  31 different phones  i think it was like 19 different people  and they all did the same exact accident  which if you knew anything about phones  it's almost an impossibility to do it once  let alone 31 different times  so we caught them and that's called obstruction  we have to remember that's called obstruction  that was the mueller group  that was a mueller group  all those phones  they were wiped so clean  and hillary got a subpoena on the 30  i said  ""forget about these things because you'll find them  they have them  they're in the state department "" i have no doubt about it  they're in the state department but they'll get them  but you know what  33 000  they have a request from the us congress  that's not bad  us congress they send a subpoena  very  very important  and after getting the subpoena  she deleted all of her emails and acid washed  and then she took her telephones  i've gotten rid of phones too  i throw them away  she took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away  and they found a couple of them  she was very angry  obviously  if she did the hammer work  but if anyone else said this  there's a protection  there's a dual level of justice  but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us  not fair to us  33 000 emails  she deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter's wedding  chelsea  and also yoga classes  33 000 emails on yoga and a wedding  i don't think so  and comey said  ""oh  that's okay  that sounds like a good reason "" that's comey  that's another beauty right there that comey  but we caught him  we caught him  very smart move  getting rid of that guy was a smart move  but we caught him  listen  we caught him  they were spying on the campaign  they were doing actually worse than that  nobody's ever done a thing like this  so let's see what happens  but we caught him cold  we got so much stuff  remember the insurance policy  right  from strzok and page  two lovers  they were very smart  they would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn't want to be caught having an affair  so they went over the public  that was a very good thing for us  wasn't it  "" darling  darling  darling  please  she's going to win  she's going to win  isn't she  peter  peter only you can save us  peter  she's going to win  yes  darling  she's going to win  i know  100 000 to nothing "" remember that  it was actually 100 million to one  this was a hundred million to one  this is this idiot  so listen  ""so darling  please  please tell me again  yes  100 million to one she's going to win  but just in case she doesn't  we have an insurance policy "" now that only means one thing  and we went through the insurance policy and we caught them  so let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks  these terrible people  and they put our nation through turmoil  but i just want to thank窶ｦ a lot of people were very unfairly treated  you look at general flynn  look  he's still going through it  can you believe it  but a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous  horrible people  and they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup  wouldn't you think  who would ever think this country窶ｦ but that's all you can say  some people would say  ""well  that's a conspiracy theory "" no  just take a look at the records  for me  it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible  now let's see what happens  but we have them cold  they spied on our campaign  it's our campaign and if you want to save america  you have to go out  get out and vote  this is the most important election  in just three and a half years we've secured america's borders  which makes them very unhappy  rebuilt the awesome power of the us military  we built the military  it was totally depleted when i took over  we built a military  two and a half trillion dollars we spent  all made in the usa  the greatest equipment  the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear  i hate to even mention the word and hope to god we never have to use it  but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world  and we did that over a very short period of time  weapons that are so powerful that we're the envy of the world  but i never want to use those weapons  and hopefully we'll never have to  you know the way you don't have to use them  is when you have them  it's when you have them  but nobody's ever built force like what we have  and the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said  ""he just gave away classified information "" i said  ""no  i will look you right in the eye "" first of all  i'm allowed to do it  i'm the president  so i'm allowed to actually  i'm the only one that's allowed to  but no  no  i didn't give away  i'm just telling you  most powerful weapons ever produced we have  and other countries know that  and it's a good thing that they know it and i don't think we'll ever be using them  and i hope we don't  i hope to god  i use the word god  because they refuse to use the word god in their pledge of allegiance  right  twice  i use the word god  i hope to god  we never have to use them  but i obliterated the isis caliphate  which was all over the place  100%  remember i got it down to 99%  they said  ""you got to go a hundred "" i said  ""let's get out of here  we're bringing them all back home  everyone's coming back home "" long  long wars  the never ending wars  the endless wars  we fixed our disastrous trade deals  they were a disaster  brought jobs and factories back to pennsylvania under 16 years  and think of this  for 16 years presidents  obama  president bush  household income rose  2 945  that's over a 16 year period  in three years  your household income rose almost  10 000  when you include energy  you have to include energy  without energy  almost  7 000  but we have to include energy  i mean  how much are you paying for your gasoline  you never saw  2 gasoline  less  right  it's less  they go up  it's less  it's a big difference  what is it nowadays  come on  tell me  i haven't got any gas  i haven't stopped recently at a gas station  15  okay  because for a while it was way under two  and we're going to keep it there  we have so much  we have so much  in my first three years we lifted 6 6 million people out of poverty  the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country  by far  we built the greatest economy in the history of the world  and right now we're doing it again  i see all these hats  make america great again  and now i'm going to say this  make america great again  again  make america great again  again  again  we saved 1 4 million jobs in pennsylvania alone and to fight the china virus  it's the china virus  not the coronavirus  corona sounds like a place in italy  a beautiful place  it's corona  no  it's the china virus  they don't want to say it  the radical left  they don't want to say it  you ever notice they're always going to have to russia  look  nobody's been tougher on russia than me  ""russia  russia  russia "" i said  ""what about china "" they never going to to mention it  they got little deals going on i think  but coronavirus  doesn't it sound like italy  a beautiful villa  corona  no  it's a china virus  they should have stopped it  to fight the china virus we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  we did an a+ job  except we did a d job in terms of public relations  explaining it because we were too busy doing it  but the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway  it didn't matter to them  it's there  it's their little thing  you have a watch biden  he can't talk about it he thinks  so he gets up  ""the coronavirus "" they say  ""we want to talk about supreme court judge today "" well  i don't know about that  ""the coronavirus "" and he doesn't know we did a great job  he has no clue  he said  ""i should have opened "" he goes  ""i should have shut down one week earlier "" what he doesn't say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu  it was a joke  and what he did  his own man  that was in charge said recently  ""we had no idea what the hell we were doing  it was a total disaster "" there were amateurs  and now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal  but he said  "" they should have closed one week early "" except when it came to closing the border  which i did  which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives  biden criticized me until two months later when he said i was right  but we should have closed a weak earlier  think of that  we pioneered lifesaving therapies  reducing the fatality rate 85% since april  think of that  remdesivir  the plasmas  we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country  nobody knows that  and i am devastated to see it happening  but you see what's going on in europe again  they were always saying  ""oh  europe is doing better "" actually we did better  but now europe has a big spike  a big spike  so they're not talking about that  the number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down  visits to hospital  europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the united states  they're liking to compare us to europe  50% greater excess mortality rate  our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through operation warp speed  you've heard about it  they don't want to talk about it  what we've done in a record period of time with the ventilators  now we're building ventilators for the world  very hard to do  we'll develop and distribute a vaccine very  very shortly in record time  it would have been two or three years  four years  if biden's group had done it  but we've done a great job with the fda in clearing a path and you'll be seeing it very shortly  and these are great companies that are doing it  so we'll crush the virus and our opponents will  with him  they will crush america  we can't let it happen  this country is too great  our love of each other is too great  this guy doesn't know he's alive  he really doesn't  he doesn't know he's alive  he did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died  and it was such a disgusting thing  i said  ""the only good thing about it is now i can take the gloves off "" this guy doesn't have a clue  he doesn't know where the hell he is and they'll give him a shot of something  i don't know  he's going to get something  because i watched him so badly  he performed so badly in the debates  and then with bernie  he was average  not great  but he got through and i said  ""what the hell is he taking "" and we'd like to ask him  and i said that  ""we want a drug test  we want a drug test  we'll both take it  we'll both take it "" because with bernie he was able to get through  but listen  it wasn't winston churchill  this wasn't the greatest  but he got through  it was fine  him and bernie screaming at each other  mostly bernie  crazy bernie  he's not too happy  i'll tell you  did you ever see a better loser than bernie though  seriously  he's a good loser  he got terribly treated by hillary and that group  and then it happened again with elizabeth warren  right  it happened again  what the democrat party did to him  and then you have this guy  mike bloomberg  mini mike  one question and he was gone  there goes 1 8 billion out their window  i said  ""you think it's easy up here  mike  don't ya "" one question and that was the end  he said  ""where am i  get me the hell off of this platform "" mini mike  mini mike  so now he's trying to buy into the party  you would think after the way they treated him  they called him every name  pocahontas destroyed him  she didn't do good against me  but boy did she do good against mini mike  i figured he'd be calling and saying  ""listen  i want to become a republican "" we've done great for the economy  you'd think  but he always wanted to run for president  and he tried before  i guess  but he tried and it was a bad experience  and you would think he would have joined our party  but instead he's trying to buy his way back in  when somebody treats you that way  even stay neutral  don't go back in  he wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship  and one thing you learned about politics  i spent a fraction of the money that crooked hillary spent  they raised  2 billion  i spent my own money  but i spent a fraction of the money窶ｦ i spent my own money  but i spent a fraction of the money  like 35%  30%  and we won  nobody ever says that  it's not about money  it's about other things  there are other things involved  it's not just about money  in the old days  my father would teach me  ""if you can win and spend less  that's a good thing "" i remember after i won and i won decisively look  306 to 223  that's a lot  306 delegates  306  that's decisive  we won michigan and we're going to win it again  we're up in a poll just now  oh  they're going crazy  they're going crazy  we won wisconsin  we won pennsylvania  but my father taught me  he said  ""if you can win and spend less money  that's a good thing  not a bad thing  that's a good thing  not a bad thing "" like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country  like when i get along with putin  when i get along with kim jong-un  whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with north korea  nothing happened  they said i gave away so much  i said  ""what did i give away "" they couldn't find that anything  i didn't do anything  they said  ""you met "" ""oh  i met  oh  okay  i met "" now you would have been in war with her  you would have been in war  but if you can spend  think of this  if you can spend less money and win  that's a good thing  so after i won one of these people back there  right back there- 窶ｦ in order to keep the thing going on trump  i had won  he said  ""but trump raised substantially less money than crooked hillary clinton "" that's because i didn't need the money  i didn't need the money  i can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money  but i feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that  it's like you're sort of 窶ｦ it's not the same  i could call up every guy  they call me up and they say  ""sir  how are you  sir  mr  president  sir "" i have friends see  i don't have too many friends up because i used to be comfortable  you have to be comfortable with people  right  i have friends  i have one friend  richard  i talk about him all the time  but multiply this times a hundred people  richard used to call me up five  six years ago  ""hey  let's have dinner "" ""all right  where do you want to go "" ""i don't know  go to some crazy restaurant "" today the restaurants are all closed in new york  they don't want to open them  they want to make them do badly until november but don't worry  they're opening in november 4th  but it's true  so  it's richard on the phone  richard  my friend for many  many years  i said  ""hey richard  how are you doing "" ""mr  president sir  how are you "" i said  ""well 窶ｦ "" he's been calling donnie and don and dj  and all  ""richard  are you okay  everything good "" ""yes  sir  mr  president  sir  you're doing a great job and i'd like to thank you "" ""good  richard  richard  loosen up please  you don't have to call me mr  parson "" i said  ""just call me donald  it's okay "" ""thank you donald  i really appreciate it "" and you hear the guy can't breathe  he's having a hard time breathing  he's very nervous  then at the end of the phone  he goes  ""mr  president again  thank you so much for the job you do "" and he hangs up  i said  how can you be friends with 窶ｦ   it just doesn't work  it's like  i've lost a lot of people this way  it's called respect for the office  they have respect for the office  they really do  nothing wrong with it  i sort of understand that  they have respect for the office  nobody has more respect for this offices than i do  that's why i'm doing a great job  and i'll always do a great job  it's respect for the office  but on november 3rd  pennsylvania  will decide whether we end the pandemic  defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before  or whether we allow sleepy joe biden  who doesn't have a clue  to kill the recovery  raise your taxes  delay the vaccine  so he wants to impose a  4 trillion tax  do you believe  4 trillion  ban american energy  which means what  hey  let's go back  let's call up the middle east and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy  no  thank you  destroy your suburbs  you know  i got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs  destroy your suburbs  i call it the obama regulates  they're building nice projects right next to your beautiful home  lots of luck  give free healthcare  i hope the people in the suburbs 窶ｦ when i did this  i took a lot of heat  i got rid of a regulation  they all said  ""sir  we'll amend the regulation  we're going to amend it "" i said  ""i don't want to amend it "" a couple of stories where written  i wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories  they were written by people that say  ""i can't believe a president had the guts to do it "" i did because i want to save the american dream  by the way  a big part of the american dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project  remember  sleepy joe  he'll do it because he has no choice because they have total power  he's like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies  to combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools  i announced last week that we are launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission  we will teach our children the truth about america  that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day  we're not going to let it fail  the democrat party has joined forces with flag burners  anarchists  anti-police people  they're extremist  agitators  and then they say  ""oh no  no  this was a peaceful protest  this is a peaceful protest "" they know what i'm talking about  they know our great uniform  brilliant  we love them  but you know what  we call it a peaceful protest now  because the only thing you're allowed to do in pennsylvania  can't go to church  right  you can't meet  you can't congregate  you can't look at each other  you can't give your wife a kiss goodnight  you've got to wear a mask  you can't do anything  they got you closed up  ""don't go out to dinner  stay where you are "" michigan  same thing like the governor  her husband went boating  it was a disaster because nobody's allowed  he was the only boat  he had this massive  beautiful lake  you know the lake i'm talking about  it's a big lake  they've got to be able to do their job  you've got to let them do their job  got to be able to do your job  right  they let you do your job  you'd see  you'd see pennsylvania  not some big  bad crime numbers in your state  you let them do your job  any state  new york's finest  by the way  i got endorsed by new york's finest  first time they've ever endorsed  and you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city  all politicians  the mayor  i got endorsed by the chicago police  can you imagine that  i got endorsed by oklahoma and i got endorsed by texas and louisiana  i got endorsed by florida  the sheriffs  all the sheriffs got together  they endorsed trump  i got endorsed by law enforcement  everybody  but how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do  and don't let you do your job most importantly  because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world  you wouldn't have problems  these are other police departments  you look at seattle  we said we're going in  and they immediately said  ""we'll put up our hands "" it was so easy  we were going in the following day  you look at portland  how about portland  it's like an anarchist's dream  we're dealing with the governor  because you know  i hate to say it  but they're all democrat-run cities and states  all of them  every single one  the republicans are doing great  but they have to ask  by law  they have to ask us to go in  but do you remember that beautiful day  it was 10 days late  you had these people from cnn and other places  ""these are friendly protests "" that's a lovely thing to say  as he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish  they go out to buy tuna fish and soup  you know that  right  goya  i hope goya  he's great  isn't he  good guy  they go out and buy goya because they throw it  they throw it  it's the perfect weight  tuna fish they can really rip it  and that hits you  no  it's true  bumblebee brand tuna  and you can throw it at soccer  you can a curve on it  you can do whatever else you want  the cops in chicago  you saw  they're going like this  it was terrible  they're not allowed to fight back  they're not allowed to fight back  these guys if they fight back  nobody's going to be there very long throwing things  but they're professionals  they're anarchists  they're paid for by outside stupid rich people that 窶ｦ they're stupid people  by the way  you know the first ones that get wiped out  they don't have a shot by the way  i'll tell you that  but if they ever did  the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff  those are the people that would get wiped out  but you know  they're very smart  everything is perfect  do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag  then they drop  everyone picks them up  throws them at our great police  we're not going to let that stuff happen  but this is all a democrat  it doesn't happen with republicans  i was with greg abbott  i was with ron desantis  texas and florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen  but they get caught  they're walking up  there're like 30 cans of soup  they have like 25 cans of tuna  they get caught  ""i'm bringing this home to my family  how dare you stop me "" no  no  no  they use it as ammunition  it's terrible shame  but he went down and he didn't like it  he was hit  ""police brutality "" you remember that  they walked in  and they've got the tear gas  they've got everything you can possibly have  pepper spray  they don't want you to use tear gas anymore  in some places like i think in milwaukee  they said no tear gas  no pepper spray  how the hell do you keep big crowds back  you can't  so the police all quit  they all quit  they said  ""we can't do it "" but you remember  they went out and you had one  then you had two  three  four  then you had five  six  seven  all of a sudden they started pouring in  they were getting off the buses  they came from a different locale  and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately  in fact  i was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other  they were right next to each other  they were touching arms and they had big  strong arms like these guys right over here  there were big strong guys  that's all right  they were like together  then you saw the first line  then you saw the second line  then you saw a third line  and then you saw a fourth line  then they said  ""march "" they never halted  just walked right through  cleaned everything up  and minneapolis was cured  they were cured  they grabbed them  they grabbed them  they grabbed them  they were grabbing them left and right  sometimes they grabbed  they grabbed one guy  ""i'm a reporter  i'm a reporter "" ""get out of here "" they throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn  but no  but i mean  honestly  when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long  when you see that  it's actually 窶ｦ you don't want to do that  but when you see it  it's actually a beautiful sight  it's a beautiful sight  behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was 窶ｦ i'd never  it's a classic  i don't know  anybody  you know what i'm talking about  is it 窶ｦ so  i just have such respect  but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best  you have to let them do what they 窶ｦ it's called law and order  we need law and order  so  democrat phenomena  if they win  sleepy joe  if they win  because he has no power over these people  these people are crazed lunatics  if they win  your cities will be like this  you'll lose all rights  your constitution will be worthless  it'll be a terrible  terrible thing  i'm not even sure that  after some time listening to that and going along with it  i'm not even sure the country can ever recover  that's how bad it would be  i'm not sure it could ever recover  over labor day  left-wing radicals rampaged through pittsburgh  harassing diners at restaurants  i saw that one  that was horrible  no  i saw that  right  i saw that  that one guy grabs a woman  a older woman  she's eating a steak  he grabbed the steak and started eating it  then he threw it back on the plate  an outdoor place  and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives  it was a terrible thing  and should never be allowed to happen  a thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started  that was terrible  remember that  an older woman  last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant  over 100 rioters rampaged in lancaster  went to school right nearby  looting businesses  setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass  you saw that  joe biden has the support of violent left wing extremists  he never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire democrat national convention  never once  they didn't talk about the riots  they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police  they didn't do it  they didn't talk about it  it's not a subject  they will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about  they will go to your suburbs next  i have the support of america's law enforcement heroes  i was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country  we're endorsed by everybody  we're joined by butler county mike slupe  thank you  mike  as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations  oh

stopped so easily  and you guys know exactly what i'm talking about  thank you very much  it's an honor to have you in the party  thank you  that's great  there's a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here  also  with us  our congressman guy russian reschenthaler  guy  where's guy  great warrior  where are they sitting  and a friend of mine and a warrior  he's a warrior  he's tough as hell  they said  ""we want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call "" oh  did you hear today  they want to impeach me again  they said  if i submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the supreme court  they want to impeach me  they want to impeach me if i'm following the constitution  no  think of it  this is crazy nancy  these people are stonecold crazy  think of it  i got impeached for making a perfect phone call  perfect phone call  everybody read it  nobody to this day 窶ｦ and the republicans stuck together  it was great  also  a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart  i remember when he heard about it  he's a rough guy and he's a popular guy too  they love him  congressman mike kelly  thank you  mike

he was a republican because his ads were so good  ""we have to respect our president  we have 窶ｦ "" i said  ""this guy's doing some beautiful ads "" and then i found out he was a democrat  i'll tell

people  i don't care and 窶ｦ "" she was very successful in every way  and it's my daughter ivanka  i just want to thank this group of people  and a man that helped  we just negotiated a major peace deal in the middle east  everyone said it was impossible  you know that  right  they said it's impossible  they've been killing everybody for years and years  they had this guy  john kerry  who's grossly incompetent  they paid  150 billion to iran  they paid 1 8 billion in cash  that's even more impressive  frankly  in cash  that's john kerry  and we just made a deal with bahrain and uae  united arab emirates  and israel  and it's a great thing  and the man right there  jared  the abuse  the abuse he takes  but he did something that nobody's been able to do  and he wants none of the glory  he'd rather not come up here  these guys will come up 100%  jared  great deal  great job  incredible  everyone's talking about it  we have plenty of other countries going to join and there's no blood in the sand  okay  thanks honey  thank you  great people  thank you  sean  thank you  sean  we have spent the last four years reversing the damage that joe biden inflicted over the last 40  they like sean  sean  will you please win  sean parnell  i'll tell you  he's popular  that's great  sean  we love sean  but biden championed every globalist portrayal of pennsylvania for half a century  he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country  nafta and china's entry into the world trade organization  which built china like a rocket ship  they were flat lined for many  many decades and then right through the roof  that was a biden approval  these disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs  you know what happened  biden shouldn't be asking for your vote  he should be begging for your forgiveness  he did a terrible job  now the democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous paris climate accord  you want to spend a lot of money for nothing  eviscerating your state's economy  you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really  it takes away your power  it takes away your energy  you'll be closing your plants and factories all over the place  i withdrew from it  and you know what  the people that understand  the smart people  they said  ""i can't believe you had the guts to do it "" and i figured i was going to be absolutely killed on this one  and you know what  i'm so proud i did it and people get it  it was a rip off of the united states  i withdrew from the catastrophe because i was elected to fight for pittsburgh  not for paris  this election is a choice between pennsylvania and china  if biden wins  china wins  when we win  pennsylvania wins and america wins  for decades  our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations  fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders  but now we're finally protecting our nation  rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs  our factories  and our troops  back home in the usa where they belong  all coming home  during the pandemic  i've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened american jobs  as our economy reopens  i want to ensure that americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages  america first  biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace us workers  you know that  and that's why never  never  i see his say  hire american  he got it for me  all the words he's got there  are my words  right  do you ever see it  they say he copied my campaign  i keep saying  what the hell happened for 47 years and now he's copying my campaign  as president 窶ｦ and you know it's not going to happen with him  as president  i know my first duty is always to take care of you  the american worker  that's what we're taking care of  under my administration  we've achieved the most secure border in us history and we are finishing that wall  it's going to be done so fast  it's got to be done so fast  since 2017 ice has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records  including over 145 000 assaults  40 000 sex offenses and 5 000 murderers  if you don't mind  democrats will bring them the hell out of our country  we'll get them out of here  some of them are so violent  we have to keep them  we don't want to house them for 50 years  but if we let them go  they come back in  as much as we watch  if they come back in  we don't want it  we don't want them  so we keep them here  we have no choice  if the left gains power  they will abolish 窶ｦ republicans will always 窶ｦ they're going to abolish  republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ice and border patrol  you have to see these ice people  they go into a den of ms13  and they call them a den  a nest  where you have these guys that are vicious  vicious gang members  and they go in there  they just start swinging  it's the craziest thing  they love it  now  who wants that job  do you want that job  look  he's a tough guy sitting here  you too  you're tough guys  you don't want any part of it  they're just incredible and they love our country  they love our country  and then people say  "" oh  they're too rough  they're too rough "" you have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do  they use knives because it's more painful  they cut people up  they cut two young  beautiful girls  16 years old  they were going home from school and they cut them to pieces  killed them  they're animals  we invested  2 5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in 75 years  space force  not since the air force  think of it  the air force was last  if i did just that  space force big deal  by the way  it's going to end up being one of the most important things you've ever imagined  but if i just did that  a sixth branch of the us military  that would be a big deal  that's like one of many  many things  we passed va choice and va accountability  we killed the founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  they were after him for a year  we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops and many others  qasem soleimani is gone  i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal  one of the great disasters  and by the way  it's practically expired  the crazy deal that obama made practically expired  and his chief negotiator  he never left  "" i want this "" ""nope  we're not giving to you "" ""okay  let's go on to the next one  give me this "" ""nope "" ""give me this "" ""nope "" ""give me this "" ""nope "" he never won a point  he lost everything  it's the worst deal i've ever seen  and the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm  and i promised everybody i would never go riding in a bicycle race  i swear to you  i kept my promise  recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  that was a 52 year development that i got done in about a day  they'd been negotiating that sovereignty over the golan heights  i got it done immediately  52 years  they worked on that  but instead of endless war  we are forging peace in the middle east  it's so great  peace in the middle east  so biden's put forward a platform that would end america as we know it  and this is true  i don't think of him as a radical lefty  but basically he's controlled by them  and what about this kamala  how about her  she at 15%  no  she's at 13%  then people started 窶ｦ no she's at 12  no  she's at 10  she's at nine  she's at seven  these are a poll numbers  she got worse than worse  she quit before she ever got to iowa  we have a great vice president  mike pence  he's great and he says hello  if elected  biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions  people with preexisting conditions  drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants  they're all going to come in  if you have that  the problem is we're going to give you healthcare  they're going to all pour into the united states and our country can't afford it  we want to be nice  we all have hearts  country can't afford it  they would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that  can't do it  they would end our travel bans on jihadist regions  we have very strong 窶ｦ remember i got travel bans  everyone thought it was such a terrible thing  such a terrible person  he's such a terrible person  i'm such a bad guy  i got travel bans  and increase refugee admissions by more than 700%  opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorism  ban school choice and all charter schools  they're very important  in the second term  i will provide school choice to every parent in america  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  and a limitless future for all americans  all americans  race  color  creed  all americans  so in conclusion  over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china  once and for all  we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states  right here in pennsylvania  we will hire more police  increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities  we'd ban them  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  thank you  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech and the right to keep and bear arms  we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless  ridiculous  stupid foreign wars  we losing our youth to countries that you'd never even heard of  right  never even heard of them  we will maintain america's unrivaled military might  and we will ensure peace through strength  we will surprise  think of the surprise medical billing  we're going to end it  surprise  you ever walk into a hospital  oh  gee  fix you up  oh  great  then you get a bill for  2 000 for a band-aid  we will end surprise medical billing  require price transparency  which i've already signed and brilliantly starts on january 1st  hey  you better vote for me  you know  i think that's  in a way  bigger than healthcare  can you imagine biden if he won  price transparency is so big  it's all done  it starts on january 1st  how smart is that  how smart  and you're going to see numbers and reductions like you've never seen  could you imagine if he were president  ""sir  our medical costs have dropped in half price  transparency has been unbelievable "" ""what is that  what is price transparency "" and they'll explain it to him  he still won't have a clue  but can you imagine giving him credit  i signed it  it's all done  it starts on january 1st  i say  ""why can't you start it now  just in case "" and know what they said  ""sir  statutorily  it has to start then "" i said  ""all right  let's go "" but i know we're going to win  so it's not going to matter  and we're going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs  we have a favored nations laws  well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction  which should have been instituted a long time ago  and the drug companies are going after me with those ads  oh  it's terrible  terrible  you know why  just every time you see an add from the drug company  they got plenty of money  that's why nobody ever fights them  anytime you see an ad from a drug company  just remember one thing  your drug prices are coming down  that's what it means  that's what it means  we will strongly protect medicare and social security and we will always protect patients  we will protect every single patient  america will land  by the way  the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  you know  nasa was an absolute disaster  grass was growing through the fairways too  they had fairways  that's about all they use  were the fairways  and now we have something  right through the runways  the landing strips  it was all grass infested  it was all weed infested  and now it's the number one space center in the world  by far  it was a closed up mess  and we have rich guys sending up rockets  elon and others  they send up rockets and we say  let them keep going  let them keep spending money on these rockets  they love rockets  we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools  we will teach our children to love our country  honor our history and always respect our great american flag  and we will live by the timeless words in our national motto  in god  we trust  for years you had a president who apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of pennsylvania  like nobody has ever stood up before  so get your friends  get your family  get your

28,23,Sep,2019,datasets/Texas,"hello  houston  i am so thrilled to be here in the great state of texas with one of america's greatest  most devoted and most loyal friends  prime minister modi of india  thank you  thank you  and prime minister modi is doing a truly exceptional job for india and for all of the indian people  it is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event  we're especially grateful to be joined by over 50 000 incredible members of our nation's thriving  prospering  flourishing  and hardworking indian american community  thank you  just a few months ago in the largest democratic election in the history of our world  600 million indians went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly for prime minister modi and his party  congratulations  mr  prime minister  that's a lot of people  earlier this week  i understand you marked another important milestone  i know everyone here joins me in wishing you a very happy birthday  happy birthday  i want to take a moment to address every resident of houston effected by the recent horrible flooding  the entire american nation is standing by your side  we're ready  we love you  we support you  we will be there with you every single step of the way  i just left the coast guard hanger at ellington field joint reserve base where i was briefed on the texas flooding  we're working with your great governor greg abbott  lieutenant governor dan patrick  attorney general ken paxton and senators john cornyn and ted cruz  thank you very much  we're working hard together  my administration will not rest until you have fully recovered  restored  and rebuilt and i know you will come back with the same tremendous spirit that we have shown every single time  every time there's been a problem  it's called ""houston strong "" prime minister modi and i have come to houston to celebrate everything that unites america and india  our shared dreams and bright futures  i've also come to express my profound gratitude to the nearly 4 million amazing indian americans all across our country  you enrich our culture  you uphold our values  you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be american and we are proud to have you as americans  we thank you  we love you and i want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day  i want to recognize us ambassador to india kenneth juster and minister jaishankar of india  thank you very much  thank you both  thank you very much  thank you  we're also proudly joined by nasa deputy administrator jim morhard  deputy secretary of energy dan brouillette  governor matt bevin of kentucky  your state attorney general  ken paxton  a couple of very great senators  kevin  thank you  thank you all for being here  thank you  kevin  thank you  we have a lot of senators  we have a lot of congress people  there's mr  brady  congressman brady  he gave us a very  very nice tax cut folks  thank you  kevin  very much  thank you all for being here  among the leaders here today for this remarkable celebration are many members of the house and senate  they're all over the audience  including house majority leader  steny hoyer  and again  senators cornyn  cruz  in my campaign for president  i promised all of that  if we were elected  india would have a true and great friend in the white house and i can tell you  you have never had a better friend as president that president donald trump  that i can tell you  the prime minister knows that  on this day  i'm happy to report that the relationship between the united states and india is stronger than ever before  the ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy  we are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence  we are governed by the rule of law  guided by commitment to justice  and strengthened by our love of liberty  our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words  ""we the people "" that means that in america amd india alike  we honor  respect  trust  empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve  under prime minister modi's leadership  the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving republic of india  in a single decade  with the help of prime minister modi's pro-growth reforms  india has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number  incredible  that's incredible  in the next decade  140 million indian households will rise to the middle class  in both india and the united states  we're seeing something really remarkable  our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape  in the united states  thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies  our economy is breaking one record after another  since my election  we have created over 6 million new jobs  we have created over 750 000 jobs right here in texas and very importantly  that includes 70 000 new texas manufacturing jobs  they said that couldn't be done  unemployment 窶ｦ think of this  unemployment in texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country  and unemployment in the united states has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number  unemployment among african americans  asian americans  and hispanic americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country  over the last two years  the unemployment rate among indian americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent  wages are rising  incomes are soaring  and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many  many years  in the past 12 months alone  the average worker has taken home  1 000 extra in rising wages and over  3 000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done  and for the first time in history  most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women  first time that's ever happened  through our pledge to america's workers  we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for american workers done through our great american companies  we passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country  we slashed a record number of job killing regulations  giving the average american household more than  3 000 every year and never in the history of our country  no matter how long the presidency  have regulations been cut to this extent  everyday  the indian american community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future  indian americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives  they're developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they're founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens  prime minister modi  i look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before  and that's what's happening  the economic miracles taking place today are just beginning  here in the united states  there has never been a better time to hire  invest  grow  and pursue your dreams  indian companies employ tens of thousands of americans across a range of industries  including american steel  in 2018 india's jsw steel announced that it would invest up to  500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of ohio  and we welcome india's growing investments right here in the lone star state  nations around the world are investing in the united states because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world  they have never invested in our country like they are today  and we want to thank everybody and india has never invested in the united states like it is doing today  and i want to say it's reciprocal because we're doing the same thing in india  on tuesday  two japanese companies  toyota and aisin  announced a combined investment of almost  800 million  which will create over 900 new jobs right here in texas  at the same time  we are working to expand american exports to india  one of the world's fastest growing markets  we are committed to ensuring the indian people have access to the finest goods in the world  product stamped with a beautiful phrase  ""made in the usa "" and very soon  india will have access to another world class american product  nba basketball  wow  sounds good  that sounds good  next week thousands of people will gather in mumbai to watch the first ever nba basketball game in india  am i invited  mr  prime minister  i may come  be careful  i may come  when it comes to expanding our commercial relationship  no issue is more important than energy security  for the first time ever  the united states is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far  with much of it coming right here from the great state of texas  that means more jobs  higher wages  and lower prices at the pump  yesterday  we were thrilled to hear about the indian company petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of lng per year from the united states  which could lead to billions of dollars of lng exports to india in the coming years  and we have plenty of it  over the last year  crude exports to india have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers  thank you  these tremendous exports not only expand employment in america  but they increase freedom and security for india  to keep our nation safe  the united states and india forging an even stronger security partnership  us defense sales to india have also reached  18 billion over the past decade  we make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and india knows that well  we're looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon  there are a lot of them in the works  here in america  we're creating the united states space force and we're working closely with india to enhance space cooperation  in november  the united states and india will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship  holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations  it's called tiger triumph  good name  it's a good name  very good name  today  we honor all of the brave american and indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom  we stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical islamic terrorism  thank you  both india and

29,9,Jan,2020,datasets/Toledo,"well  thank you very much  vice president mike pence  great job you're doing  and hello toledo  we love toledo  you remember  i was here a lot  you remember 2016  what a year that was  right  and 2020 is going to be even better  no doubt  but i'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of ohio  and as we begin the new year  our economy is booming  wages are soaring  workers are thriving  and america's future has never  ever looked brighter  ever  we're the envy of every country in the world  we've created seven million brand new jobs since our election  and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as nafta with the incredible brand new usmca  the historic victory for ohio farmers  workers  and manufacturers  but really a great victory for the united states  it's an incredible agreement  you remember i came and i'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are  we did a brand new one with korea  so now we have south korea  we just finished a big one   40 billion with japan  on january 15  we're signing a monster  a big beautiful monster   40 to  50 billion to our farmers  our farmers will be taking in  i keep saying go buy larger tractors  go buy larger tractors  i said there's no way  i don't know if you know this story  my people wanted 20 billion to purchase  right  20 billion  20  that's a lot money  that's a lot of corn   20 billion  and i said  ""make it 50  china's very big "" and they said  ""okay "" they said  ""sir  the farmers can't produce that much "" i said  ""let the farmers tell me that  tell them to go out and  remember  and buy a bigger what  tractor  buy a bigger tractor "" you'll produce it  so  40 to  50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies  and we brought a lot of car companies into ohio  you know that  a lot of them are coming in  a lot of them have already been brought in  they're coming in from japan  they're coming in from all over the world  this is where they want to be  they want to be in the united states  this is where the action is  they're all coming back  i used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving  they were all leaving  a lot of you were victims of that leaving  these companies would leave  they'd go to mexico  they'd go to canada  they'd close up  they'd buy from china  now they're all coming back  new ones  old ones  they're all coming back  and many are coming right here to ohio  and just in case you didn't know it  ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state  that's not bad  that's not bad  and this year's going to be even better and maybe much better  but weeks ago  i signed the largest ever investment in the united states military    738 billion  and we created the sixth branch of the united states armed forces  the space force  and everybody's excited about that  after years and years of devastating defense cuts  we have fully rebuilt the united states military  some of it's still coming in  we have everything  we've got new planes  we've got new rockets  new missiles  we've got new everything  and it's either here or coming in   2 5 trillion in new investments  so our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before  and if you remember  three years ago when i took over  we were depleted  our military was totally depleted  and by the way  speaking of our military  have we taken care of our vets with choice  with choice  that was a big thing  you know  i used to go around and the va was a terrible situation  people would wait weeks  he's right  he said  ""yes  it was "" you don't hear too much about that anymore  have you noticed  choice and accountability  you know what accountability is  for 44 years  they tried to get accountability  that's somebody bad  works for the va  you couldn't fire them  you couldn't fire them  they could be sadistic  they could be thieves  they could be whatever they were  you couldn't get rid of them  we got accountability approved  and now we say  ""you're fired  get out "" we get somebody that's good  44 years  and maybe most importantly of all is choice  va  veterans choice  so you now wait in line  and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five  six weeks you couldn't see a doctor  now you don't have to wait  you go out to a private doctor  you get yourself taken care of  we pay the bill  what a difference it's made  what a difference it's made  you know  when i was a little bit newer to this game窶 that's okay  they got it  they got it  they go home to mommy  go on home to mommy  go on home to mommy  it's a beautiful sight  thank you  security  do we love law enforcement  by the way  so with the va  i used to go around saying  ""why don't they do that  why don't these people  why don't they go to a private doctor and work something out "" and i thought it was a brilliant plan  i said  ""i'm telling you i am such a smart guy "" i said  ""this is the most brilliant thing ever "" and i went back to my people and i said  ""i have an idea  a veteran's sick  they can't get the kind of service they need  they need a certain kind of doctor  i have an idea  such a great idea  you get to go out  private  you're going to pick out a doctor  you're going to get yourself fixed up  we're going to pay the bill  right "" and you know what happened  and i said  ""how brilliant is that "" they said  ""sir  we've been working on that for 48 years  but we've never been able to get it approved "" so i was very  very disillusioned  but you know what i'm good at  getting things approved  and we got it approved  so we signed that 11 months ago  and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health  people would wait online for weeks  and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill  they couldn't get to see the doctor  now they go out  they get a doctor  we take care of them  we can take care of our vets  so we're using this great power not to pursue conflict  but to really preserve  and i mean in the true sense of the word  preserve peace  we have this tremendous military  and you know what that is  that's really a great fighting force  but i hope we never have to use it  i really do  you saw an example of that a couple of days ago  so we seek friends  not enemies  but if you dare to threaten our citizens  you do so at your own grave peril  we've never had a military  what we have now  we've never had anything like it  we were looking at planes that were old and tired  50  60-year-old planes  you've heard the story  the grandfather flew them  the son flew them  the current wonderful person flew them  the whole family flew them  those are all gone now  folks  those are all gone  in october of last year  us special operations forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of isis  the animal known as al- baghdadi is dead  and the entire isis caliphate is destroyed  and his terrorist empire  and he was indeed a monster  has been totally demolished  we killed thousands and thousands of isis warriors  fighters  and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be  nobody has ever done what we've done in three years  and i'll say this  when we took it over  it was a mess  we did it in a short period of time  but when we took it over  it was not good  and last week  the united states once again took the bold and decisive action to save american lives and deliver american justice  and you know what i'm talking about  for years  the sadistic mass murderer  qasam soleimani  planned and executed attacks against american targets  killing and wounding thousands of us service members and many  many thousands  and even hundreds of thousands  of other people  as the leader of iran's terrorist quds force  soleimani spread death  destruction  and mayhem across the middle east and far beyond  he ordered the violent assault on the american embassy in baghdad  and you saw this was the anti-benghazi  we got there very quickly  we got there very quickly  this is the exact opposite  we did it exactly the opposite of benghazi  where they got there so late  all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before  that's all they saw  we got there very early  we saw what was happening  i saw what was happening  and i said  ""what's that all about "" and that was going to be another benghazi  had they broken through the final panels of glass  they were breaking and breaking it  had they gotten through  we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages  that wasn't going to happen  and i called up our great generals  and i said  ""get them over there now "" and one of our leaders  one of our really admired people  said  ""sir  we'll have them there tomorrow "" i said  ""nope  get in the planes right now  have them there immediately "" and they got there immediately  fortunately  but he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four american service members  badly wounded  and killed an american citizen  that was just before we happened to hit him  soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies  and not just the embassy in baghdad  but we stopped him  we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold  so at my direction  the united states military eliminated qasam soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world  but much bigger parts of the world  he was all over  he was a bad guy  he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror  he's dead  and yet now i see the radical left democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist  and you know  instead they should be outraged by soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long  he was the king of the roadside bomb  you know of the roadside bomb  and then they got bigger  and he'd send them over to afghanistan and iraq  and when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors  when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage  it's most likely that he caused that damage  because that's what he liked  he loved planting the roadside bomb  so now he's gone  and that's a good thing  bernie sanders  crazy bernie  has condemned the us military strike on soleimani  the world's top terrorist  think of it  the world's top terrorist  and we're having people like nancy pelosi  that's a real genius  do you believe that one  nancy  nervous nancy  but here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military  whoever was in his way  and we have bernie and nancy pelosi  we have them all  they're all trying to say  ""how dare you take him out that way  you should get permission from congress  you should come in and tell us what you want to do  you should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it "" that's a lot of corruption back there  folks  no  but think  seriously  so they want me窶ｦ so these are split-second decisions  you have to make a decision  so they don't want me to make that decision  they want me to call up  maybe go over there  let me go over to congress  or come on over to the white house  let's talk about it  when can you make it  well  i won't be able to make it today  sir  so how about say in a couple of days  oh  good  come on over  no  we got a call  we heard where he was  we knew the way he was getting there  and we had to make a decision  we didn't have time to call up nancy  who is not operating with a full deck  no  they want us to call  can you imagine calling crooked adam schiff  he's so crooked  he's so crooked  shifty schiff and say  ""gee  adam  how are you doing  listen  we have the world's number one terrorist  killed thousands and thousands of people  we'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution  would you be willing to meet "" ""well  i won't be able to make it this week "" ""well  you know  he's traveling fast  we got him lined up  adam  you little pencil-neck "" nine inches  he buys the smallest shirt collar you can get  and it's loose  now come on  adam  we got to meet faster on it  we got to take this guy out  we're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again  ""but i can't make it now because i'm trying to impeach trump  i'm trying to impeach  even though he did nothing wrong "" by the way  did you see  i did nothing wrong  they don't even know what in the hell is going on  in fact  it's so weak  she doesn't want to put in the articles  it's so weak  they're so pathetic  they're so pathetic  so they want us to call them  now  schiff is a big leaker  he leaks to crazy cnn  see with the little red light on over there  not too many people are watching cnn  but he leaks  so he'll say  ""you know  off the record  i got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway on my cell phone  off the record they've got the number one terrorist in the world  soleimani  and they're going to get him  they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes  please  don't tell anybody i told you "" so we have breaking news  president trump within the next 20  25 minutes  looks to be taking out terrorist general soleimani  he's going to do it  it should be happening in about the next 20 minutes  19  18  17 "" then we get back to the battlefield  how'd you do  fellas  ""i don't know  sir  he disappeared  i don't know what happened to him "" they want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media  you got to say though  that's a lot of media  right  that's the way the academy awards used to look when it was successful  then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful  i love it  i love it  actually  oh  they have some bad ones here tonight  they have some really bad ones  some really sick ones  they have one good one  by the way  one good one  they have one good one  a bunch of bad ones  very  very dishonest people and we have some great ones  too  we have some great journalists  great reporters  but you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like i have never seen in my life before  they write things that they know are wrong  they write  if you watched for the last three years  think of it  and then they get pulitzer prizes  but it turned out to be all wrong  how do you do that  they get pulitzer prizes for being wrong  the pulitzer prize doesn't mean a thing  it doesn't mean a thing  i mean  i'm here to tell you about the nobel peace prize  i'll tell you about that  i made a deal  i saved a country  and i just heard that the head of that country is now getting the noble peace prize for saving the country  i said  ""did i have something to do with it "" yeah  but you know  that's the way it is  as long as we know  that's all that matters  i saved a big war  i saved a couple of them  but under my administration  we will never make excuses for america's enemies  we will never hesitate in defending american lives  and we will never stop working to defeat radical islamic terrorism  never  and nobody's done it like we've done it  and it's we  it's we  it's not me  it's we  it's a whole movement  there has  by the way  never been a movement like this  you know  outside  i don't know what this place holds  it's like 10  11 000 people  right  outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in  there's never been a movement like this  there's never been a movement like this  and i'll tell you  maybe i'm wrong  but this is bigger than it was in 2016  because in 2016 i said what we're going to do  but now i've completed more promises than i've made  i mean  i've actually completed more  right  like  as an example  many of you were here  look at all those beautiful red hats  keep america great  that's good  but i never talked about  did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about space force  i never talked about it  we did space force  but did we ever speak about it  no  there were many things that we've done that we never spoke about  right  right to try  you know about right to try  right  they've been trying to get it for 44 years  right to try  that's people that are very sick  terminally ill  and they can't get medicine that possibly works  and very well  we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world  the greatest scientists in the world  we have the greatest medicines in the world  if they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years  i brought those times way back  by the way  way down  but they would travel to asia  they would travel to europe  they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick  i said  ""wait a minute  they're going to die  they're going to die "" ""well  sir  we can't take the liability "" i said  ""then we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability  taking all liability away from the country  away from the insurance companies  away from the healthcare companies  away from the doctors "" and with the great help of a lot of incredible republicans  and we had some democrats help us  we passed right to try  and you have to see how this works  some people are being  many people are being saved  and you know  the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick  because they didn't want it on their charts  i said  ""i understand that  we won't include that  we'll have a separate list over here "" they said  ""oh  would you do that "" i said  ""yeah  i'll do that  i'll do that "" but i didn't talk about right to try  i never said i was going to get that done  we got it done  that was a tough one to get done  it sounds simple  but it was tough  there's nothing easy in this country  you know  they said to me  a friend of mine the other day  ""who's the toughest country to deal with  president "" he used to call me donald  i've known this guy for a long time  i'd like to say 20 years  but it's much more than that  i just don't want to tell you how long  it's too long  and i said  ""call me donald  you've always called me donald "" ""i can't "" he calls me mr  president  i've known this guy forever  he used to call me  ""hey  donald  let's go out to dinner "" you know before  he'd go  ""hey  let's go out to dinner "" now he goes  ""mr  president  sir  how are you "" right  how are you  but what we've done  and he said  he told me  ""what you've done  we've never seen anything like it "" so many people are saying that  we are all together doing something  not only in terms of the election  not only in terms of what we're doing right now  don't forget  it's a long way to the election  you know  we have what  10 months  that's a long way  this is my first stop of the year  first major stop of the year  this is it  and we start  by the way  let's do one of those polls right now  do you mind  is there anything more fun than a trump rally  here we are  anything more fun than a trump rally  here we are  we have the greatest phrase of all time  make america great again  and all due respect  i'll never end 窶ｦ i'm a little superstitious  i'll never end it  make america great again  but i see all those hats  i see all those hats  changing it a little bit  but make america great again  i said  you know  today  we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country  your 401ks are at records  your stocks are great  but what it really means to me is jobs  more importantly  than anything else  we have the best jobs  the best everything  right  we just hit 窶ｦ i can't really say  make america great again  our military is rebuilt   2 5 trillion  our military is rebuilt  we're doing great numbers  economically  our country is the strongest it's ever been  you have factories moving back into ohio  you never saw anything like it  right  you had your best year  when i say make america great again  what that sort of means is we didn't get there  but we did get there  now  i have a new theme  it's called keep america great  keep america great  now  i'm a very loyal person  and i am concerned about changing the theme because make america great again i think was the greatest political campaign in history  i mean  crooked hillary spent three or four times more money than i have spent  crooked hillary  wait  crooked 窶ｦ we should lock her up  i'll tell you  crooked hillary spent three or four times more  i wanted to be a little bit 窶ｦ i have to say  that was a great campaign  and i don't want to change it  i don't want to have this incredible 2016  then go with something  and if something ever happened  this country will go to hell  i just 窶ｦ you know the stocks i'm talking about  the records  you don't have records this way  you have records  get used to it  because if that happened  you will see things happen that aren't good  but  i have to now say  do i want to change the greatest theme in political history  make america great again  with keep america great  right  let's take a little applause  right  we'll go make america great again  you'd clap if you want that  then we would go  keep america great  you'd clap if you like that  okay  are you ready  first  make america great again  ready  keep america great  you know  that  i call that a free poll  that's better than a poll  do you ever see these crazy polls that come out  we're doing great in the polls  by the way  remember  i used to come out and talk about the polls  we'll start doing that very soon  we're doing great in the polls  but this is like a free poll  somebody else would go out  they have all this

slightly off  if it were  if i was off by two factories  there'd be a headline  donald trump told a fib  donald trump gets to be a pinocchio again  no  think of it  60 000 factories  plants and

president "" anybody that says that  i said  ""that's the end of his career "" remember  he had the cover of the magazine  i won't mention the magazine  sleazebag magazine  he was born to be president  and right after that  he came tumbling down  but he's from texas  so he was against religion  he was against oil  and he was against guns  abraham lincoln could not win in texas with that platform  that's not a good platform  it's not a good platform  but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry  if you do that  you're going to shut down half your businesses  it's really more than that  and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive  we have all forms of energy  we have every form of energy  and we are doing great  but they want to cripple your state's economy  the voters of ohio will never let that happen  never going to let it happen  our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years  sadly  i can't say historic because  you know  a couple of hundred years ago  there was nobody here  right  i assume that 2  300 years ago was cleaner  probably  you never know  but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been  and i took us out of that horrible paris accord  i always say  ""how are you doing with the paris accord "" don't ask  saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us  in my opinion  it was put in there to hurt us  we were paying money to india  we were paying money to china  china's didn't kick in until 2030  we kicked in immediately  we had to

right  who would make a deal like that  no  how unfair  you look at russia  you look at china  you look at india  they all got these massive breaks  we got no breaks  and we're paying money  i say sometimes to france  ""how are the yellow vests working out "" because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of  so  we are in good shape  it took a certain amount of courage to do that  i said i'm going to get killed on this one  and you know what  i did it  and i was applauded  because the people get it  the people know what we're

that's going to include  because we take care of our great auto workers of toledo  the home of jeep  how good is jeep  i've taken the toughest-ever action against china's chronic trade abuses  including tariffs on  370 billion worth of chinese made goods  bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury  i gave some of that money  because they were targeted  to our farmers  and our farmers did just fine  now  the deal is done  and the other deals are done  and the farmers are doing very well  we love our farmers  and they never complain  they never complain  you know  when they'd go  the fake news back there  they'd go and they'd talk- and when they come  the fake news back  they go and talk to the farmers  ""what do you think of president trump  china is deciding not to buy anymore of this "" you know what the farmers would say  ""we're going to have to suffer for a while because there's china and there's other nations have been ripping us off for years  the president is right and we're with the president "" how great  how great  but our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable phase one trade deal with china  and again  we're keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money  we are taking billions  remember what i said  we're not paying for it  because china devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot  we're not paying for it  and now they're starting to say  ""i guess he was right "" and our trade deficit  as a result  has come  has really come substantially down  it was just in the papers today  the trade deficit has come down  as a result of our actions  steel mills all across ohio  you know this better than i do  are roaring back to life  jsw steel is investing five hundred million dollars in acero junction  republic steel is reopening the loraine mill that they idled in 2016  charter steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in cuyahoga heights and nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in marion  ohio  think of that  i think you do  the steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant  all told  american steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation  think of that  they weren't investing 25 cents  the industry was dead  now it's vibrant  after years of rebuilding other nations  we are finally rebuilding our nation  we are finally putting america first  but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists  the washington democrats are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts  think of it  the day they came down that escalator it started  who the hell else could they take in this stuff  right  can i get some credit for that  most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying  ""mommy  mommy  take me home "" these are bad people  the democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to ohio jobs in factories  they destroyed your factories  they destroyed your jobs  but they're losing and we're winning and america's comeback continues full speed ahead  on no issue have democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the american people than the issue of illegal immigration  far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt  scorn  and disdain for everyday americans and the american family  these jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob  attack  and kill american citizens but stop it  they want open borders  can you believe it  and because of democrats' open border policies  they want open borders  they want more people flowing  come on in  come on in  innocent americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals  as just one example right here in ohio  you all know about it  an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree  attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl  then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman  then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children  and finally the police came  we love our police  and they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal  thanks to democrat policies  ms-13 gang members窶ｦ they're the worst窶ｦ were allowed to infiltrate

thoroughfares  what happened in san francisco  in particular her district  and she lives in this beautiful house  but they turn all these arsonists out  including killing their victims with machetes  ms-13  they kill them with machetes  you know why  because it's more painful than using a gun  federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 ms-13 gang members in central ohio  and they will be sent to jail or frankly  i they hold them窶ｦ i don't know that they can hold them  they're going to be sent the hell back home  last year alone  ice officers  who by the way are heroes  these are brave people  i don't want to do it  you don't want to do it  let's see  you can do it  you can do it  you can do it  most of you wouldn't  i mean  i've seen it  they have these people that are like killers  and now the guys are here  and they want to call them a safe place  and they run in and they're swinging and punching  what the hell kind of a job is that  that's what they do  they're tough people  they're great patriots  who the hell wants to do it  they're incredible  ice  and they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 members every single year  they throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country  but ice offices worked through ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets  and on all your street  do you see the difference now between what it is now  we have a problem over there  go ahead  take your time  take your time  good  thank you  great job  thank you  okay these people here  unlike you up there  these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here  i don't know  you know what  if i had to wait three days  i think i'd like your seat better  i like your seat  but democrats stand for crime  corruption  and chaos  republicans stand for law  order  and justice  that's really the way it is  we side with law enforcement  with law abiding americans  not law breaking criminal aliens  we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands  we are sending them home  and we will no let them back in  and i have to tell you  a lot of things are happening  you're going to hear about that in two seconds  thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border  illegal crossing are down 75% since may  we have ended catch and release  catch and release  you know what catch and release is  we catch them  we take down their name and we release them  what kind of crap is that  these are the policies that we inherited  you catch somebody  take their name  say ""please come back in three years "" right  and we're releasing them back to the community  and if you don't do that everybody gets sued  can you believe this  we have ended catch and release  the other one  beauty  how about that lottery  it's called visa lottery  how about this  they put their hand窶ｦ these people are going to america

who is that  so anyway  but  in honduras  guatemala they have like this lottery  now the people  i've gotten to know the government officials  they're good  they've made some good things  they said  ""hey we need to take our people back "" they're getting their people back  before  they wouldn't take them back  they'd send them here to go into our county  we'd bring them back under past administrations and then after that  they'd say  ""we're not taking them back  we're not taking them back  take them the hell our of here  we're not letting you land your plane "" so we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners  bad people back  now they take them back  you know why  because we said  ""look  if you don't take them back  we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell "" now they say  ""we'd love to take them back  we'd love to take them back  we'll take them back gladly  sir "" no  they couldn't get them back  we'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them  we couldn't land the plane  we couldn't get anything through the border  it comes through the border this way  not that way  but now they take them back  they've been good actually  they've been very good  now we paid them a lot of money  we paid them 500 million dollars a year  can you believe we paid them 500 million through el salvador  and i said  ""oh  there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right "" and they've been good  they've been great  they take them back

100 miles  and by the end of next year  we're going to have a lo more built  and it's already having a big impact  how about that  democrats  ""walls don't work  we want technology "" i said  ""what

five years ago  the democrats all wanted a wall  they just could never get i built  they didn't know how the hell to build it  i do  so we built 100 miles  i think probably more than that now  we have a lot under contract  but we won our big case just窶ｦ i woke up  they said  ""sir  we have good news  they overturned a horrible decision from the lower court  you can now fund the rest of the wall "" i said  ""thank you very much "" thank you  fifth circuit court of appeals have changed some  they want crime  they want gangs  i'm saying all this stuff and then i say  ""gee  now i sort of understand why they hate me "" right  but it's true  it's true  their policies are a disaster  they're bad politicians and they're horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then they're vicious  they're vicious  horrible people  i didn't say that  they're horrible people  what they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party  but we've done things nobody's ever done before  but the democrats are taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders and that group  omar  aoc  talib  this is a jihadist woman  talib  talib  boy  what a

want to say great things about it  okay  i don't want to knock it and then say  ""oh  we're not going to use that "" i like it when they say  ""you no longer can fly airplanes  no longer can you have

they make the tanks  they make all of these army vehicle  and i said  ""these people are amazing  you could never close this  you could never re-open it again "" they'd been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible  and i looked at the tanks they made  they're the best in the world by abrams  they're the best in the world  i said  ""wait a minute  if you close this  we're not going to be窶ｦ where are you going to build tanks  this is the primary factory in the whole country  i think it might be the only factory in the whole country ""  ""please send us 200 tanks "" ""we don't want to send you any tanks because we're going to kick your ass "" we're going to make our own tanks  right  we've got to make our own tanks  so i did something  based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else  based on my instinct  i said  "" you can't close this plant "" i went through that plant  i spent two  three hours talking to people who worked there  i looked at some of the hydraulic and i'm  i love all in the world  tractors  all of that stuff  i know a lot about it  and i looked at the carvings  i looked at the metal  i looked at how perfect everything was that turns around  how perfect it fit  they put it on and it would fit like within 1/100th of an inch  and i said  ""you're not going to be able to do this anyplace else "" i said  ""and we're going to be expanding our military  we're going to be rebuilding  who the hell's going to make our tanks if you close "" i said  ""keep it open "" i actually  it was all closed  is there anybody from lima  is that a true story  right  it was closed  they announced it was closed  it was all set to close  i said  ""you can't close this plant "" and now look  the numbers i just gave you  we're making almost 500 new tanks  you could've never reopened a place like that  it's incredible  and you could've never gotten those workers  they're really skilled people and if you did it would cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it  it wouldn't have been as good as we have  so that was something i did that i'm very proud of because i really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close  i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and we further recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  52 years  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of ohio  and saying our present battle is the survival of the american nation  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for  and fought so hard to secure  then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020  we have to win  you know  we have to win  because all of these things that we've done can be undone  and you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast  very very fast  only in this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  and i have seen that dirty rotten swamp better than anybody else in america  a lot of crooked people  disgusting crooked people  with your help  we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the u s a  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america  nobody knew that  it could've been done long before i got here  they had the technology  but we're ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years  isn't that amazing  whoever thought that was possible  who would have thought that's possible  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we will always live by the words of our national motto  ""in god we trust "" we stand on the shoulders of generations of ohio patriots who gave their blood  sweat  and tears for this beloved nation  from cleveland to cincinnati  from dublin to dayton  and from columbus to toledo  this state is the home of proud families and farmers  and miners  and manufacturers  and aviators  and astronauts  ohio is where the wright brothers invented the airplane and where annie oakley got her gun  ohio is the state that gave us american legends and american heroes like thomas edison  neil armstrong  and the great john glenn  ohio is the place where strong american workers mined coal  worked the railroads  and forged the steel that made america into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world  and we are making it greater than ever before  proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country  we are returning power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion  and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going to keep on winning  winning  winning  we are one movement  one people  one family  and one glorious nation under god  america is thriving like never before  and ladies and gentlemen of ohio  the best is yet to come  because together  we will make american wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america proud again  we will make america safe again  and we will make america great again  thank

30,20,Jun,2020,datasets/Tulsa,"thank you  thank you  so we begin  oklahoma  we begin  thank you  oklahoma  and thank you to vice president mike pence  we begin  we begin our campaign  thank you  we begin our campaign and i just want to thank all of you  you are warriors  i've been watching the fake news for weeks now  and everything is negative  don't go  don't come  don't do anything  today it was like  i've never seen anything like it  i've never seen anything like it  you are warriors  thank you  we had some very bad people outside  we had some very bad people outside  they were doing bad things  but i really do  i appreciate it  we have just a tremendous group of people in oklahoma  and i hear  i hear from your two great senators and your governor that we're doing very well in oklahoma  that's the word  that's the word  i stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before  five months from now  we're going to defeat sleepy joe biden  boy  does he get a pass from these people  huh  we're going to stop the radical left  we're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for americans of every race  color  religion  and creed  republicans are the party of liberty  equality  and justice for all  we are the party of abraham lincoln and we are the party of law and order  think of what we've done  we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time  that's an all time record  that's an all time record  i've always heard how important judges are  now we know how important they are  think of that over 300  around 300  by the end of the term  and when we have another four years  we're going to have a big  big percentage of the total number  very important  november 3rd  and two great supreme court judges  so we have two justices of the supreme court  justice gorsuch  justice kavanaugh  they're great  they are  they're great  we have two  and we could get a few more  yeah  we can get a few more  we've spent over  2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the united states military  and all of that incredible equipment  whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters  bombers  it's all built in the usa  we passed v a  choice  thank you very much  jim  where's my senator  jim inhofe  you better vote for him  he's running  he's great  but we'll get to him and james lankford in a second  two great senators  you have two great senators  so we passed v a  choice  so if you're a veteran  for years and years  they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years  we got it done  we get a lot of things done  and so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week  two weeks  three weeks  five weeks  seven weeks  two months  what happens is you go outside  you get a private doctor  you get fixed up and they pay your bill  we take care of the bill  we take care of the bill and you get immediate service  it's never happened before  and our approval rating at the v a  is now 91%  that's how good it is  never been anywhere near that number  never been anywhere near that number  and v a  accountability  we had a lot of bad people in the v a  people that didn't love our vets  people that were sadistic  people that stole  a lot of bad people  you couldn't get rid of them because they were  let's say it could be unions  it could be civil service  right  let's say  let's just say  and so you couldn't get it done  that was another one for decades and decades  they wanted to get it changed  and i got it done with those people and your congressman  your congressman who i'm going to introduce  v a  accountability  and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say  we say  you're fired  get out  right  get out  they got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time  sort of like me in washington  draining the swamp  i never knew it was so deep  but it's happening  it's happening  i never knew it was so deep  it's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters  thank you  we're lowering the price of prescription drugs  making our allies pay their fair share  they get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals  that finally  finally  after all these years put america first  i've been saying it for a long time  we passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country  the democrats want to raise your taxes  tell me about that  tell me about that  i guess i'm old fashioned  all my life  all my life  i heard politicians want to lower taxes  not raise them  if you could lower him  you couldn't lose  the democrats want to substantially raise your taxes  how do you figure that  how do you figure that  and regulation cuts  we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country  and with the help of our great energy workers  many of them come from the great state of oklahoma  do you ever notice that biden  no  do you ever notice that biden oftentimes gets the state wrong  he's in iowa and he says it's good to be in idaho  no  no  you're in iowa  he's in new hampshire and he says it's great to be in ohio  no  no  no  you're in new hampshire  that happens to him all the time  hasn't happened to me yet  when that happens  there's nothing you can do to make up for it  you might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster  right  right  but we just turned the united states into the dominant energy super power of the world  of the world  and because of the chinese virus  what happened about three months ago  it looked like we were in big trouble and we were  and i got it back together  i called russia  right  i called russia  i called saudi arabia and believe it or not  i called mexico  mexico was a little bit tough  that's called opec plus  did you ever hear of opec plus  that's opec plus plus  and we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost  40 a barrel  meaning you have an energy business again  almost  40 a barrel  couple of months ago  it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs  10 million jobs  so texas and oklahoma and north dakota  and many other states would have been hurt  now you think you're going to be hurt there  you try putting aoc in judge of your energy  that will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy  she has one problem  it's called petroleum  no president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the trump administration  not even close  nobody  how about the cnn anchor  how about the cnn anchor  you know  did a little shave job in the head  which is fine  and he's standing in front of a building saying  ""things are very peaceful here "" and the building is  it looks like the biggest fire i've ever seen  the whole town is burning  it's like the biggest fire  and he said  ""things are very good here  anderson  i think it's great  these are wonderful people  anderson "" did you ever see that  it looked like the world was coming to an end  and we did something in minneapolis after watching for three or four days  i called  i said  ""you got to get 窶ｦ you can't protect yourselves "" i got them to take 8 000 national guardsmen  and in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem  and we did the same thing in other cities  but how about seattle  isn't that great  so they take over a big chunk of a city called seattle  i mean  we're not talking about some little place  we're talking about seattle  have you ever been to seattle  they took over a big chunk and the governor  who's radical left  all of these places i talk about are democrat  you know that  every one of them  every one of them  and i'd have an offer out  i said  ""anytime you want we'll come in  we'll straighten it out in one hour or less "" now i may be wrong  but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster  i flew in with some of our great congressmen  who we're going to introduce it a second  and i said to them  ""congressmen  what do you think  i can straighten it out fast  should we just go in  no  sir  let it simmer for a little while  let people see what radical left democrats will do to our country "" but americans have watched left wing radicals  burn down buildings  loot businesses  destroy private property  injure hundreds of dedicated police offices  these police officers  they get injured  they don't complain  they're incredible  and injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was  and they never talk about covid  they don't talk about  when you see 25 000 people walking down fifth avenue or walking down a street of a democrat run city  you never hear them saying  they're not wearing their mask  you don't hear their say  as they're breaking windows and running in  and then when i say the looters  the anarchists  the agitators  they say  ""what a terrible thing for our president to say  what a terrible thing "" but you don't hear them talking about covid  covid  to be specific  covid-19  that name gets further and further away from china  as opposed to calling it the chinese virus  and despite the fact that we 窶ｦ i have done a phenomenal job with it  i shut down the united states to very heavily infected but all people from china in late january  which is months earlier than other people would have done it  if they would have done it at all  i saved hundreds of thousands of lives  we don't ever get even a mention  then i closed it down to europe early  closed it down because i saw what was happening  and by the way  most people said  don't do it  don't do it  we saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible  and what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment  and with testing  you know  testing is a double edged sword  we've tested now 25 million people  it's probably 20 million people more than anybody else  germany's done a lot  south korea has done a lot  they called me  they said  the job you're doing 窶ｦ here's the bad part  when you do testing to that extent  you're going to find more people  you're going to find more cases  so i said to my people slow the testing down  please  they test and they test  we had tests and people don't know what's going on  we got tests  we got another one over here  the young man's 10-years-old  he's got the sniffles  he'll recover in about 15 minutes  that's a case  add him to it  that's okay  that's a case  i was actually with a very nice man  very good man  even though he's very liberal  the governor of new jersey  right  we know him  now listen  he said to me  something that's amazing  new jersey was very heavily hit  very hard hit  thousands of people  he said with thousands of people that died  thousands of people  there was only one person that died under the age of 18  would you believe that  which tells me one thing  that kids are much stronger than us  when you see a little kid running around say  ""boy  oh  boy  do you have a great immune system  how about a piece of your immune system "" they don't even know about this  let's open the schools  please  open the schools  open the schools  we got to get them open  in the fall  we got to get them open  the unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history  desecrate our monuments  our beautiful monuments  tear down our statues and punish  cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control  we're not conforming  that's why we're here  actually  this cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as americans  they want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place  they want to defund and dissolve our police departments  think of that  00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough  i've used the word on occasion  hombre  a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do  and you call 911 and they say  ""i'm sorry  this number's no longer working "" by the way  you have many cases like that  many  many  many  whether it's a young woman  an old woman  a young man or an old man and you're sleeping  so what are you going to do  right  so they want to defund  they really do  this as a serious movement  and in minneapolis  the council's already passed it  in seattle  you see what's going on there  it's even worse  okay  these people are stone cold crazy  they're crazy  you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours  we have a great heritage  we're a great country  you are so lucky i'm president  that's all i can tell you  people have come up to me  say  ""how do you take it "" i say  ""do i have a choice  do i have a choice "" we deal with a lot of bad people  but we're winning  and every once in a while  i'll have one of these days where i'm hit left and right  left and right  like even this great event  if you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports  the reports  ""oh  it's covid "" it's this again  by the way  it's a disease without question  has more names than any disease in history  i can name  ""kung flu "" i can name  19 different versions of names  many call it a virus  which it is  many call it a flu  what difference  i think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name  but they say to me  ""where do you get the energy "" i say  ""i don't have a choice  i don't have a choice "" it was interesting  to show you how fake they are  you might've seen it  so last week they called me and they say  ""sir  west point  west point  we're ready "" i said  ""oh  that's right  i have to make the commencement speech at west point "" just to show you how bad the fake news is  so they say to me  ""sir  we're ready to go "" i say  ""let's go "" this is after saying hello to a lot of cadets  inspecting little areas of a building  that was very exciting  actually  it's beautiful  very old  studied a lot of our great generals  some of our presidents that went there  west point is beautiful  right on the hudson river  but after an hour  the general that runs it is a fantastic guy  after an hour  we land  we do some more inspections and they say  ""sir  are you ready  yes  i am "" so we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks  which is fine  we go onstage  which is fine  they make speeches  then i make a speech that lasted a long time  i don't know  maybe 45 minutes  maybe longer  i don't know but a long time  the sun is pouring down on me  okay  but they said to me before the speech  ""sir  would you like to salute each cadet  each single cadet  or maybe there'll be in groups of two  would you like to salute  like this  yes "" like this  almost 600 times  you know what that is  600 times  thank god they were in twos because let me tell you  you do that 600 times  you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight  right  600 times  so i did that  then the incredible helicopters  brand new gorgeous helicopters  the apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that  but i make this speech  i salute for probably an hour and a half  maybe more  but around that  watch  if i'm off by two minutes they'll say  ""he exaggerated  it was only an hour and 25 minutes  he exaggerated  he lied  he lied  he's a liar "" these people are sick  the fake news  so then i finish saluting my final salute  i said  ""thank goodness  thank you very much "" think of it  so essentially almost 600 times  now the general says  ""sir  are you ready "" i said  ""i'm ready general  where are we going now "" you have to understand i left early in the morning to get there  now it's sort of late in the afternoon  a lot of these fakers were with us  so they know  he said  "" sir  we can now leave the stage "" i said  ""great general  let's go  i'll follow you "" and he goes like this  ""right here  sir "" and i walked off  the stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long  i say  ""general "" now you got to understand  i have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and i want them to love their president  i did this big thing  i love them  i love them  they're incredible  and they do  i said  ""general  i've got myself a problem  general "" because i'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces  it's not good for ramps and if i fall down  look at all those press back there  look at them  this was a steel ramp  you all saw it because everybody saw it  this was a steel ramp  it had no handrail  it was like an ice skating rink  and i said  ""general  i have a problem "" and he didn't understand that at first  i said  ""there's no way "" he understood  i just saluted almost 600 times  i just made a big speech  i sat for other speeches  i'm being baked  i'm being baked like a cake  i said  ""general  there's no way i can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass  general  i have no railing "" it's true  so i said  ""is there like something else around "" ""sir  the ramp is ready to go "" ""grab me sir  grab me "" i didn't really want to grab him  you know why  because i said  ""that will be a story too "" so now i have a choice  i can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till i'm rescued or i can go down this really steep  really  really  really 窶ｦ it's an ice skating rink  it's brutal  so i said  ""general  get ready because i may grab you so fast "" because i can't fall with the fake news watching  if i fall  if i fall  i remember when president ford fell out of the plane  do you remember  i remember when another president  nice man  threw up in japan  and they did slow motion replays  it's true  right  ""i don't want that  general "" now he's standing there  big strong guy  and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because i looked  the first thing i did  i looked at his shoes  then i looked at mine  very  very slippery  so i end up saying  ""okay  general  let's go  i will only grab you if i need you  that's not a good story  falling would be a disaster  it turned out to be worse than anything  i would have been better off if i fell and slid down the damn ramp  right  so what happens is i start the journey  inch by inch  right  i was really bent over too  i didn't like that  i didn't like this picture  this picture i'm sure will be an ad by the fakers  so i was bent over  right  bent over like this  then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news  the most dishonest human beings  they cut it off  you know why  because when i was 10 feet short  i said  ""general  i'm sorry "" and i ran down the rest  right  i looked very handsome  that was the only good  i wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad  so i took these little steps  i ran down the last 10  and by the way their tape  take a look  in almost every instance  it ends just before i run  and they said  ""here was the number one trending story "" i call my wife  i said  ""how good was that speech  i thought it was a 窶ｦ"" hey look  i will tell you when i make good ones and bad ones  like so far tonight  i'm average  but we're having fun  we're having fun  so far tonight  but i call my wife and i said  ""how good was it  darling "" she said  ""you're trending number one "" i said to our great first lady  i said  ""let me ask you a question  was it that good of a speech that i'm trending number one  because i felt it was really good "" no no  they don't even mention the speech  they mention the fact that you may have parkinson's disease  it's true  it's true  it's true  they say there is something wrong with our president  i'll let you know if there's something wrong  okay  i'll let you know if there's something  i'll tell you what  there's something wrong with biden  that i could tell you  so then my wife said  ""well it wasn't only the ramp  did you have water "" i said  ""yeah  i was speaking for a long time  i didn't want to drink it  but i wanted to wet my lips a little bit "" you're drinking  you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you  i love this location  the sun's like this  this way they save on lighting  right  that's why they did it probably  so what happens is i said  ""what does it have to do with water "" they said  ""you couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water "" i said  ""i just saluted 600 times like this  and this was before i saluted  so what's the problem "" she said  ""well i know what you did  you had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive "" it's silk because they look better  they have a better sheen to them  and i don't want to get water on the tie  and i don't want to drink much  so i lift it up  the water  it's so unfair  it really is  so unfair  they are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth  they're bad people  bad people  okay  that's enough of that  i wanted to tell that story  does everybody understand that story  the left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of thomas jefferson  now we're getting into the real stuff  they decapitated a statue of christopher columbus  except in new york when the italians surrounded it  they didn't have too much of a chance  those italians  i love the italians  they heard they were going to rip down their beautiful christopher columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing  they didn't do too well in hurting christopher  did they  thank you to our italian population  we're very proud of you  right  two days ago  leftist radicals in portland  oregon ripped down a statue of george washington and wrapped it in an american flag and set the american flag on fire  democrat  all democrat  everything i tell you is democrat and you know we ought to do something  mr  senators  we have two great senators  we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the american flag  you go to jail for one year  one year  jim and james  jim and james  we ought to do it  you know they talk about freedom of speech and i'm a big believer in freedom of speech  but that's desecration  that's a terrible thing they do  we used to have things  we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open  so everything  and look what happens  we should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the american flag and stomp on it or just burn it  they go to jail for one year  okay  in seattle the democrat mayor and the democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist 窶ｦ now these are anarchists  these are not protestors  you listen to the fake news  they say  ""oh  the protesters were lovely "" could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over seattle  they'd have machine guns out to get them  but these people can take over the city  look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business  and now they're wiped out  take it away  governor inslee ought to get his act together  get in there  i'll help you  i'll do whatever you want  i'm waiting for a call  i would love to do it  i would love to do it  it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back  yet biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation  joe biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob  he has no control  does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs  you know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister  ""get me the hell out of there  these people are crazy "" that's what he says  he has absolutely no control  you know a lot of times i'll make like a speech and i'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech  beautiful  brilliant  but joe didn't 窶ｦ it'll say  ""a comment from joe biden "" but he didn't say it  professional people  great students in english lit  people that are very smart say it  joe biden said  and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph  beautifully worded and i say  ""joe didn't say that  joe doesn't even understand it "" wait a minute  air force one is 31 years old  people don't realize that  so i said  they gave me a charge  very early in my administration like how about the first week  ""sir  would you sign for this plane "" now it's actually two planes  ""would you sign for this plane  air force one "" i said  ""how old is the original or the one we have now "" ""sir  it's 31  32 years "" i'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us  rich countries but they can't compete with the 窶ｦ they have a brand new beautiful 747-800  and i say  ""wait a minute  that country has new and we have a 31-year  so somebody had to do 窶ｦ""  this was the boeing before that and they were riding high  like i was before this thing came in  but we're still riding high because you know what  on november 3 we're going to win  we're going to win  so they came in and they came in and they said  ""no no no  we want  5 6 billion  whatever it was "" whatever it was  if i'm a little bit off they'll go crazy  whatever  but it was a lot   5 6 billion  nope  got to have a three  got to have a three  call me up  nope  cancel the contract  i said  ""cancel the contract  i want it canceled "" i said  ""general  can you cancel the contract "" he said  ""yes sir  i'm very proud of it "" ""oh good  cancel it "" ""okay sir "" ""by the way  to cancel it  do you have to pay anything "" ""yes sir  we have a cancellation fee sir "" ""how much is it  general "" "" 250 million "" i said  ""what "" ""sir  we made a good deal   250 million to kill "" ""you mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them  250 million "" that's not good  right  look at these two guys  they're looking  by the way  that's like a good story compared to some i could tell you  like with aircraft carriers  so they said  "" 250 million "" or i always say this  or around that number  because if i'm off by a little bit  they say  ""oh  he exaggerates "" i look at numbers all day long  that's what i look at for years now  for my whole life when you think of it   250 million cancellation fee  sir  he was very proud of himself  what a great 窶ｦ i say  ""general  don't cancel  don't cancel  just tell them i don't want the planes  don't put anything in writing  don't put it in writing  general "" ""why sir "" ""because i don't want to pay 250 "" true  you hear that jim  jim inhofe  he's great  you hear that jim  you know that story  he does a great job  so here's what happened  the bottom line  boeing says  ""no way  no way  no way "" the next week they say  ""no way we're doing it "" the next week they said  ""how about  5 billion "" i said  ""no way  no way "" the next week they said  "" 4 8 "" i said  ""nope  it's got to have a 3 at the front of it  don't you understand  you dumb son of a bitch  don't you understand "" i turned out to be right  turned out to be right  nobody gets that  nope  got to have a three  next day  they come back  "" 4 5 is our best offer "" ""nope  i'm not doing it  i'm not doing it  come back when you're ready "" a month goes by  another month  they never heard about it  they never heard from me  they thought i was serious  i was  and they came back at  4 billion  that's a lot of money but i save like a billion six or a billion seven  nobody wants to talk about it  nobody wants to talk about it  when i get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars  nobody wants to talk about that  when i take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly  germany is an example  i mean i have a german heritage like some of you  i said  ""let's get it down from  50 000 00 to  25 000 00 because they're delinquent  for many years they're delinquent  they haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying  they're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number "" and they say  ""yes  we think by and they say  yes  we think by 2030  maybe 2032  we could get current  i said  ""no  angela  please  don't say that angela  it's true  you know who i'm talking about  by the way  very nice woman  very good negotiator  i said  ""angela  that's a long time "" this was in 2019  she said 2032  i said  ""no angela  that's not working "" but i said  because now they want to get cared  but i said  ""well  what about the last 25 years  all the money you owe us "" everybody forgot about that  they forget about all the money that wasn't paid  i said  ""what about the trillion dollars that you really owe "" so we're negotiating let's see  but in the meantime  we're reducing our troops  remember this  we're supposed to protect germany from russia  but germany is paying russia  billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline  so they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from  they pay billions of dollars to that country  we're supposed to protect them  excuse me  how does that work  and the great thing is with jim inhofe and with james lankford  likewise  they just said they love you james  when they hear it  they get it  a lot of people don't get it  they get it  we cannot continue to be ripped off  we're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it  and that means that a lot of people don't want me here  they don't want me  there are a lot of people that don't want me  they don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people  you know that  right  it's called the military industrial complex  when rioting and looting broke out in our nation's capitol  i very quickly deployed the national guard  i said  ""get them in "" after watching for an evening or two  we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets  and last night that had a little breakout  again  they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old  beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television  we're not happy  that's going to be very expensive for dc  they're always looking for money  ""we need more money  we always need more money "" and then they don't do the proper job  so it's not going to be good for mayor bowser  mayor bowser there  they were heading over to the jefferson memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great  beautiful jefferson memorial  not going to happen  don't worry about it  we have it surrounded with very strong people  the choice in 220 is very simple  do you want to bow before the left wing mob  or do you want to stand up tall and proud as americans  and explain this to the nfl  i like the nfl  i like roger goodell  but i didn't like what he said a week ago  i said  ""where did that come from in the middle of the summer  nobody's even asking "" we will never kneel to our national anthem or our great american flag  we will stand proud and we will stand tall  i thought we won that battle with the nfl  the stadiums were emptying out  did you see those stadiums  it took them a long time to get you back  a lot of people didn't like that  a lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much  i've had people that i said  ""these are super left liberals and they didn't like it "" joe biden and the democrats want to prosecute americans for going to church  but not for burning a church  they believe you can riot  vandalize and destroy  but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-america rally  they want to punish your thought  but not their violent crimes  they want to abolish bail  abolish and open up your borders  they want open borders  let everyone  and by the way  we're doing so well  we have a record this month on the borders  nobody's coming in  very few people  and they want to abolish ice  our great people from ice who send the roughest toughest  meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard  generally speaking  when they have lots of tattoos on their face  they're not looking to do you much help  ice  they're rough guys  they're great americans  but they'll walk into  they caught them in a pack  they'll walk into a pack of tough ms-13 gang members  and we shouldn't say this  it's not nice  they want us to negotiate  they start swinging  and the other such way  everybody's swinging  at the end  they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon  they're great  and these people want to get rid of ice  they get rid of murderers  they get rid of rapists  they get rid of the worst scum on earth  and when i called them animals  i said  ""they're animals "" and nancy pelosi  they cut up a young woman  they cut up a young woman and her friend  cut them up with a knife because it was more painful  dead  cut them up with a knife because it's more painful  it takes longer than shooting a gun  they cut them up  i said  ""these are animals "" and nancy pelosi said  ""these are human beings  they're not animals "" if i lose an election over that  you know what  this country is in big trouble  they want to disarm law  abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious ms-13 gang members  in joe biden's america  rioters  looters  and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens  and that's true  in my administration  we defend american citizens and we deport ms-13 members or put them in jail if we have to  the chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities  these are all run by the democrats  is what will happen in every city and community and america  and much  much worse if we don't keep them out  we have to do this  we have to go to the polls on november 3rd and the rest of you know what to do  you know what to do  got to keep the white house  joe biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal  calamity  and failure  he never did anything  he was a senator  he was a vice president  he was before that something  you know what's great  president  trump was tough on this or he was tough  they complained  never did anything about it  he's been there for 43 years or 47 years  he never did anything about it  biden's supported every globalist attack on the american worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves  including nafta  the disaster of nafta  he wanted to go and tpp would have ruined our automobile industry  korea  i renegotiated the deal  i took a horrible deal  that was a hillary clinton special  that was a hillary clinton special  she said  ""we have to make this deal with south korea  it's going to mean 250 000 jobs "" and she was right for south korea  250 000  and china's entry into the world trade organization was supported by sleepy joe biden  that was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country  when china joined the world trade organization  they were flat line for decades  they became like a rocket ship  he voted for the war in iraq  he voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens  he supports sanctuary cities and now biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens  when i took early and decisive action to ban travel from china and protect americans from the virus  and as i said  joe biden  opposed my decision and called it hysteria  xenophobia  he doesn't know what the word means  xenophobia and fear-mongering  and then he apologized a month later  he said he was wrong  but he didn't say it  and they didn't cover it  they didn't cover it  on one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime  joe biden sided with china over america  that's closing the border  he thought it was a terrible thing  remember  this was in january  that's early  real  early  the end of january  he thought it was a terrible thing  when we close the border  too many people that were badly infected with covid  when the chips are down  biden will always cave to the radical left  he'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that  joe biden will always let you down  that's been his history  at my direction early this year  the heroes of the u s  military took out the world's top terrorist  the savage killer leader of isis al-baghdadi and the number one terrorist  anywhere in the world  qasem soleimani  we took them out  joe biden opposed killing soleimani  he was vehemently窶ｦ we killed this number one  terrorist  he didn't like it  you know why he didn't like it  because he thought it would be good politically  that didn't work out too well  just as he opposed the raid that killed osama bin laden  he opposed it  you know that  biden is always on the wrong side of history  as said by people that are with him and worked with him  he never made a correct foreign policy decision  biden is a puppet for china  son walked out with 1 5 billion  i think it's a little bit窶ｦ allowing them to rip off america for many years  now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars  we give a lot of it to our farmers  we have plenty leftover  china is not exactly happy with me  they pay us billions and billions of dollars  and they targeted our great farmers  and i took the money that they targeted  i took that money and i gave it to the farmers  so they were even so they're okay  are you okay  come  doctor  please  doctor  thank you  these people some of the people are waiting for five days  especially in this location  you take your time  darling  take your time  thank you very much  take your time  doctor  thank you  doctor  some people wait for four or five days  that's incredible  he never did anything against china  joe biden  and that's why they desperately want him to win  they want him to win so badly  iran wants him to win so badly  let me tell you  i'm going to make a very fast deal  the best deal you've ever seen  i've already made one with china  but i can make even more  they want me to lose because they will own the united states if i lose  iran  president obama gave them  150 billion for nothing  i told them  and look what happened to biden in ukraine where his son's paid  83 000 a month  and he was jobless  give me a break   83 000 a month  more than anybody  if joe biden were to become president an emboldened left  will launch a full scale assault on american life  you know that  they'll expel anyone who disagrees with them  look what happens when you disagree  you use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it  they call you a racist  they call you a horrible person  they want to crush religious liberty  they don't want religion  silence religious believers  indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country  subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution  they want to take away your guns through the repeal of your second amendment  as sure as you're sitting there  in fact  he even put the big gun grabber  beto o'rourke  who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president  they put him in charge of guns  lots of luck on your second amendment  just remember i said  and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much  because it won't matter  hopefully it won't matter  no  beto o'rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment  the dems will also eliminate private health insurance  ban fracking  that's not good  and american energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before  and that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far  and they want to appoint supreme court justices who will utterly obliterate your constitution  and you now see how important the supreme court is  think if we didn't have two justices  that i think have been very  very  very good  but think how important it is  think how important it is  and we still  i guess it's a  i don't know if it's an equal court  it's almost like we're a minority court  right  it's almost like we're a minority court  the recent supreme court cases prove that if joe biden is elected  he will stack the court with extremists  the forgotten men and women  together with everyone else  we'll lose everything  the forgotten men and women  i campaigned on the forgotten  these are great people  these are substantial people  these are the elite  by the way  you're the elite  they're not the elite  you're the elite  somebody two days ago said  ""sir  the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you "" i said  ""yeah  why do you call them the elite "" i said  ""why "" ""well  they're not elite "" i look better than them  much more handsome  got better hair than they do  i got nicer properties  i got nicer houses  i got nicer apartments  i got nicer everything  i ran for politics once  just once in my life  and i became president of the united states  and hopefully if you get out and vote  we'll do it one more time  we won't even toy with them about three or four more times  we won't  we'll do it one more time  we'll be two for two  and our country will never  ever be stronger  but i'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the united states supreme court  and i'll choose only from that list  a hundred percent  probably 25 incredible people  any one of which could be a great justice  any one of which  and i did it last time and people loved when i did it  and i'll only pick from that list  biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme  too radical  they wouldn't be acceptable  but they will be very radical people  people don't understand  but we actually won on daca yesterday  we actually won because they basically said  ""you won  but you have to come back and redo it "" it's almost like  ""gee  come on back  your paperwork was no good "" but we're going to be refiling  but don't let it get you  everything's going to work out really good  everything's going to work out good  it was a great  it was great  i mean  would have been nice if we won  and everybody said  ""oh  you're going to win daca  you're going to win daca  that's easy  you got to win daca  that's easy "" they all said it  and they came back and they said  ""we don't like what you did with your paperwork "" essentially  so we're re-filing it  most people would say we lost  we didn't lose  we're going to refile it  and everything is going to work out for the young people  most of whom aren't so young anymore  by the way  but we're going to work it out for everybody  biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party  he is their pawn  he doesn't even know where the hell he is  let's face it  he installed socialist alexandria ocasio-cortez  to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy  energy  you can forget petroleum  how does oklahoma feel about being petroleum free  not good  right  our country will have no energy  our country will have nothing  oklahoma  texas  north dakota  and many others will all be out of business  i don't think that's going to work out too well  but she's actually in charge of environmental policy  and you know what that means  she doesn't even want to win  she doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round  you want to see a lot of birds that are dead  go under a windmill sometime  she wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense  no credentials  she's got a little charisma  not much  but she doesn't have a clue  you know it  but she's in charge of the environment  no airplanes  we can forget boeing  i guess  come to think of it  we talked about boeing  we could forget boeing  let's cancel those brand new air force ones  likewise  representative ilhan omar is going to be very much involved in a biden government  they will put this hate filled america  bashing socialist  front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country  i don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came  somalia  no government  no safety  no police  no nothing  just anarchy  and now she's telling us how to run our country  no thank you  and i think we're going to have a big victory in the state of minnesota  because they've had it  they've had it  biden is a very willing trojan horse for socialism  when biden first ran for president over 33 years ago  remember i used to call him 1% joe  he never got more than 1% until obama took him off the trash heap  but he blatantly copied the speech of a british politician  even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own  he forgot to say he was born in america  joe biden is a shameless hypocrite  since 2003  he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral  and at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation  including a former member of the kkk  and yet biden is now smearing as racist  tens of millions of people like yourselves  decent  hardworking americans who he's never met  and he frankly probably doesn't want to meet  america should not take lectures on racial justice from joe biden  sleepy joe  a man who praised and partnered with segregationists  shift millions of black american jobs overseas  and everyone else's jobs too by the way  if i didn't come along  we're building auto plants  we're building everything  and there's never been a comeback like we're making right now  never been  he hollowed out our middle class  including our black middle class with open borders  trapped young children in failing government schools  built cages  those cages were built by obama and biden  look it up  2014  and the fake news doesn't wanted to窶ｦ remember the picture of the cage  a cage for children  remember the picture of the cage  and they said president trump  and then they realized that was at a newspaper  2014  the same窶ｦ built by obama and biden  the cages  and they don't- and they don't want to report the way it is  they know the way it is  they're not stupid  they sent young boys to fight in iraq while the inner cities crumble  helped the big banks while hammering community leaders  and made our cities less safe and secure for all  they've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded  they should not get rewarded with an election victory on november 3rd  that shouldn't happen  it'll destroy this country  our country will be destroyed  we've all worked too hard  they don't know what the hell they're doing  some do actually  but in a very sinister way  virtually every policy that has hurt black americans for half a century  joe biden has supported or enacted  i've done more for the black community in four years than joe biden has done in 47 years  racial justice begins with joe biden's retirement from public life  we are joined tonight by many outstanding republican leaders  these are great people  we have two of our most distinguished  hardworking  wonderful friends  senators  they do a great job  senator jim inhofe and james lankford  please stand up  two very respected  i will tell you  two very respected people in washington  they're respected by everybody  they do some job  and i'd have you come up  but you can relax  i will say this  jim is running on november 3rd  jim inhofe  he's running on november 3rd  i don't even know  does he窶ｦ hey  james  does he have any competition  is somebody actually running against窶ｦ there's no competition that he's got  i know he's got james' support  he's got my support  i give him 100% endorsement  jim inhofe  i'd give it to james too  but he's not running this time  thank you  jim  great job  thank you very much  what a great senator he is  also here is a man who's respected by so many  he's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight  senator tom cotton of the great state of arkansas  thank you  tom  they like you people  thank you  tom  great job you're doing  we're glad to be joined as well by a man that i've gotten to know  he's done an incredible job with covid and with everything else he touches  governor kevin stitt  thank you both  thank you both for being here  thank you  lieutenant governor matt pinnell  thanks  matt  thanks  matt  and representatives frank lucas  tom cole  he's been here for a little while  he's done an incredible job  markwayne mullin  you don't want to fight with him  i want to put him and jim jordan in a match together  i want to  kevin hern  great job today  kevin  the great jim jordan  jim jordan  elise stefanik  lee zeldin  tom emmer  tom  thank you  these are warriors  folks  these are great warriors  during the fake impeachment trial  i'll tell you what  there was nobody that could have done the job they've done  that includes the senate and the house  these people are incredible  david kustoff  david  a great friend of mine  debbie lesko  arizona  great job  debbie  great job  and a man who's got very good genes  greg pence  thank you all  great job  they're great窶ｦ they are  they're warriors  i'll tell you what  not every person is  but this group is  and we have a lot of them in washington  and we'll send jim inhofe back  and we'll send all of them  you'll send every one of them  they have to come back because they have been fighting for us  and they've been fighting for you  and they are just incredible  talented  tough  strong people that love your state a lot  so thank you very much  so we built the greatest single economy in the world  and then we say not only the world  but actually in the history of the world  and they never even challenged me  so i guess i'm right  we did it  we had the best numbers anybody's ever had  we have the best employment numbers  african american  hispanic american  asian american  the best employment numbers in history  the best stock market numbers in history  we were the envy of the world  everybody would come in to see me  presidents  prime minister  kings  queens  and dictators  dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy  and then the plague came in  and now what we're doing is we're doing it again  and it's going fast  we have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it  we're doing record business  it's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe  two weeks ago  job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country  last week  retail sales numbers came in  retail sales  the single greatest number in the history of our country  so here's what's going to happen  here's what's going to happen  they blame a president for anything  when you see looters  even though we put them down  if we didn't stop them  nobody would because the other side will never stop them  but they always blame a president  here's what's happening  we're going up  we're going up  we're going up  we're going to go up  then we're going to hit october  we're going to be up  we're going to be way up  we're not going to be where we were  but in many ways  other than all of the horrible  horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated  which was china  but we're going to go up  up  up  up august  september  october  and people are going to say  ""man  this guy is doing a good job  he knows what he's doing  i don't believe the fake news anymore "" and you're not going to want to lose your 401k's  and you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated  whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge  and if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes  it will be a whole different ball game  so i'm not putting any pressure on anybody  but in the end  we're going to have a phenomenal economy  and next year we're going to have a good third quarter  but next year  and i said it before  will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had  okay  and if you see that happening  if you see it happening on november 3rd  you don't have the guts to vote against trump  you  even you  you don't have the guts to vote against trump  say  ""wait a minute  darling  my 401k is higher than it was the last time  i don't think i want to take a chance "" you're not going to want to do that  the stock market has been the best  think of this  go back one week and go back 50 days  in that 50 day period  it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market  think of it  and your wife or your husband says  ""darling  i love you so much  you are such a great investor "" and all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time  right  ""darling  i love you so much  you've always been a loser  you've always lost money  but now under president trump  you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country "" and all you did was keep your stock  what's wrong with having these great economic numbers  what's wrong with having to close it down  we saved millions of lives  you know  a lot of people say we should have gone herd  let's go herd  ask them how are they doing in brazil  he's a great friend of mine  not good  you heard about sweden  right  too much  ask them how they do it in sweden  we saved millions of lives  and now it's time to open up  get back to work  okay  get back to work  i recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform  i secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities  we slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never  ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses  and i worked closely with a great senator also  friend of theirs  senator tim scott  south carolina  to create opportunity zones  which are doing incredibly  and since then countless jobs and  100 billion of new investment  not government investment  have poured into 9 000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country  9 000  never happened before  tim scott  today  i'm also announcing that i have directed secretary of the interior david bernhardt to place the john hope franklin reconciliation park here in tulsa on the african american civil rights network  so many of my friends have been asking me to do that  so many of my friends  including these great politicians  so we're going to do that  it'll be done very quickly  we will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country  democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools  jobs  housing  justice  and crime  in major city public schools run by democrats  over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math  and i think the numbers are worse than that  but democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter  public  private  religious  or independent schools of their choice  pro choice  pro choice  pro choice for schools  it's very popular  but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the democrats  even though they know it's wrong  republicans believe access to education is a civil right  it's a civil rights  20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in america are controlled by democrats  think of that  20 of 20  and so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%  they're controlled by democrats  we can name every one of them  the murder rate in baltimore and detroit is higher than el salvador  guatemala  or even afghanistan  how are they doing  the democrats running those cities  your whole country will be like that  in 2018 alone  our police arrested nearly 12 000 people for murder and manslaughter  25 000 people for rape  and nearly 1 5 million for assault  violent assault  the democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe  thousands of innocent lives will be lost  as president  i will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement  a vote for republicans is a vote for better schools  better jobs  safer families  and stronger communities for all americans  there is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years  with your help  we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence  and poverty to prosperity  that's what's happening  that's what's happening  and that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see  it was happening before this covid came in  it was happening at a level that nobody believed possible  and then china sent us the plague  thank you very much  we will protect medicare and social security for our great seniors  and we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions  always  always  we will appoint more judges to interpret the constitution as written  we will end deadly sanctuary cities  we will finish the wall  which has now 212 miles built and beautiful  212 mile  that's a lot of miles  and let me tell you  you think that was an easy one  that was a tough one  that party was totally unified against building the wall  you know  in the end they gave up  you know what happened  they realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders  i love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas  there's something wrong with those people  so did you notice in the end it was like  ""just leave us alone  build your wall  just leave us alone "" i said  ""thank you very much "" and we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration that puts american workers first  we will revitalize our cities  and we will build gleaming new roads  bridges  tunnels  and airports all across our land  we will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase  made in the usa  it's so beautiful  so beautiful  made in the usa  that's happening too  we have so many plants coming into michigan and so many other states  we have car plants coming in would have never come if i wasn't president  would have never come  we will become the world's premier pharmacy  drug store  and medical manufacturer  that's already started  we're bringing it back  we will keep america out of foolish  stupid  ridiculous foreign wars  we will never hesitate to kill america's terrorist enemies  when i took over  isis was all over the place  and i did something that i felt we should do  and we have now obliterated  we have now captured 100% of the isis caliphate  100  100  and like our depleted military when i took over  like our empty shelves  medically  when i took over  like all of the things that when i took over  it was a mess  we have done a job  you had to see what isis was doing  they were getting bigger  bigger  bigger  bigger  bigger  i came in  smaller  smaller  smaller  ""sir  we've just taken 100% "" we will launch a new age of american ambition in space  and the united states will be the first nation to land on mars  good program  you saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up  beautiful  we will defend privacy  free thought  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  and when you see those lunatics all over the streets  it's damn nice to have arms  damn nice  interesting how all of a sudden people understand it  right  you couldn't sell it  now people understand it  the right to keep and bear arms  we'll protect your second amendment  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we will support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we uphold the principle of equal justice under the law  we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government and bureaucracy are the true american way  we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and always salute our great american flag  and we live by the words of our national motto  it will never change  ""in god we trust "" we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans  blazed the trails  settled the continent  tamed the wilderness  dug out the panama canal  laid down the railroads  revolutionized industries  won two world wars  defeated fascism and communism  and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world  and we are making it greater and greater every single day  proud citizens like you helped build this country  and together we are taking back our country  we are returning the power to you  the american people  with your help  your devotion and your drive  we are going to keep on working  we are going to keep on fighting  and we are going

31,1,Nov,2019,datasets/Tupelo,"ell  thank you very much  and hello  tupelo  this is great to be with you tonight  the great state of mississippi  the great state of mississippi  and by the way  the birthplace of a gentleman  not too many people heard of him  elvis presley  but to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in god  family and country  right  four days from now  this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor  republican tate reeves  great guy  great guy  under republican leadership  jobs are booming  confidence is soaring  wages are rising  crime is falling  and our nation is stronger than ever before  we're now an economic powerhouse  we've never been in a position like it  we've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength  and by the way  for those of you with a thing called 401ks  the stock market hit  today  another all-time historic high  unemployment in mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded  ever recorded  that's not bad  that's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say  ""we have the best economy we've ever had  we have the best military we've ever had  the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had "" said  ""got the best president we've ever had "" thank you  thank you  thank you  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  four more years  thank you very much  and very importantly  we've confirmed more than 158 brand new  beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written  in a very short while  we'll have 182 federal judges  president obama left us 142  thank you very much  thank you very much  president obama  he left us 142 openings  can you believe that  you're supposed to leave none when you leave office  but that didn't work out too well  and just days ago  the united states brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice  we have great military  it was very  very depleted  when i came into office  it was very  very depleted  but it ain't depleted anymore  yep  al-baghdadi  the founder and leader窶ｦ look  you've heard about it for a long time  i kept saying  ""where is al-baghdadi  that's the one i want  where is he "" and then  by the way  the following day  we got number two  i don't know if you read about that  but he was the founder and the leader of isis  and he's dead  and baghdadi  he was a savage and soulless monster  but his reign of terror is over  american special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell  i guess you could say  he spent his last miserable moments on earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the american warrior that was right there going right up  no enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the united states military  and mississippi loves our military  that i can tell you  and our military loves mississippi  america is winning again  and america is all  over the world  respected again  it's about time  but while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists  the democrat party has gone completely insane  the radical left is determined to transform america into a country you would not recognize  we are the ones standing in their way  and we will never get out of their way  it will be easy  from even before we won the election  the far-left democrats and the fake news media right back there窶ｦ look at all of them  oh  it's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't  they wouldn't be here  look at how many  it's like the academy awards before it failed  right  and you know why it failed  because they disrespected us  but the media and the democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership  trying to impose their will and to thwart american democracy by any means necessary  you see what's going on  first  they engineered the russia hoax  that was a total hoax  the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the american people  then the mueller witch hunt  it never ended  with 18 angry democrats and an unlimited budget  let's go get him  that didn't work out too well  did it  that fizzled  and a lot of bad people along the way  and now corrupt politicians  nancy pelosi- 窶ｦ and shifty adam schiff  shifty  and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt  this is one i never thought i'd be involved in  the word impeachment窶ｦ to me  it's a dirty word  not a good word  totally phony deal  they know it  everybody knows it  and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now  it's true  and if you think you have a lot of people in this room  all you have to do is go outside  you'll see a lot more people trying to get in  so if anybody wants to give up your seat  please just walk out  anybody want to leave  because there really is  there's no place better to have a rally  to have a good time  and to also  at the same time  be very serious than at a trump rally  especially on friday night in mississippi  we could have done this one on monday night  i said  ""let's do friday "" right  yesterday  the democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million americans  disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives  they've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment i won  but the people here that are highly sophisticated  though  long before i won  19 minutes after i took the oath of office  the horrible newspaper  fake  fake  fake washington post  declared  ""the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun "" at least they gave us 19 minutes  yesterday's vote by the radical democrats is an attack on democracy itself  but i'll tell you  the republicans are really strong  the strongest i've ever seen them  the most unified i've ever seen them  right  the most unified i've ever seen them  the american people are fed up with democrat lies  hoaxes  and extremism  the democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing democrats out of office in 2020  make no mistake  they are coming after the republican party and me because i'm fighting for you  they don't like it  this is different  they've never had anything like this  well  they've never had an election like 2016 either  have they  they never have  they've never quite figured it out  you're the man  and they know they can't win  so let's try and impeach him  how about that crazy representative  al green  right  ""you know  we got to impeach him because we can't beat him "" i don't think so  right  i don't think so  al green  he's another beauty  the democrats  the media  and the deep state are desperate to stop us  and it's not me  it's us  it's all of us  it's 63 million  but it's much more than 63 million  much more  and right now  our numbers are higher than they've ever been before  they've never been this high  but they want to stop us because they know we are here  and that's what we're doing  and that's what's taking up so much time  we're draining the swamp in washington  nothing terrifies democrats more than the fact that all of their spying窶ｦ spying  they actually spied on my campaign  can you believe it  i mean  you know  they try and say  ""well  we were actually just checking things out  oh  that's wonderful "" the lying  the falsifying over the past three years plus  before i ever even announced they were spying  i guess they knew we were going to win  right  but over that past more than three years is finally being exposed  and remember this  that truth is a force of nature  desperate to conceal their misdeeds  the democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the bidens  just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds  33 000 emails  33 000 emails disappeared  but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding  33  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  lock her up  she's a beauty  how about last week  did you hear  i don't know who tulsi gabbard is  but i know one thing  she's not an agent of russia  and jill stein  she's a greenie  that's fine  we love the environment  everybody in this room  you know  right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had  and yet we're number one in the world in energy  by far  we took over  but i don't know jill stein  she ran last time  i don't know  but i know she's not an agent of russia  and when hillary made those statements  two statements  both of them  ""they work for russia  they're agents of窶ｦ"" i said  ""you know  when she made that statement about me three years ago  it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement "" she made it about them  everybody laughed because of what we proved  but i'll tell you what  these are very bad people  these are very dishonest people  and the media is worse than all of them  but think about the preposterous hoax the democrats are now trying to peddle  i've just beaten  with no窶ｦ look  look  we didn't have too much political experience  i did a good job  built lots of buildings all over the place  had great success in show business  just did one show  it was called the apprentice  and it was a big success  14 seasons  and when i left  crazy arnold took over  it didn't do too well  it was dead  it was dead from the first episode  i saw him  i said  ""oh  it's terrible  what have they done to this beautiful show "" arnold  but think of it  i've just beaten  with no political experience  the clinton dynasty  the bush dynasty  the president barack hussein obama dynasty  and president obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked hillary clinton did  right  he was all over the place  it's the only time i've actually seen him work hard  when it came to trying to beat trump  true  true  remember he said窶ｦ remember he said  ""he will not be president""  well  that didn't work out so well  and then they figured they could take us out a different way  very dishonesty  right  with the lying and the spying and the leaking  and we are kicking their ass  i'll tell you  in the delusional democrat fantasy  i'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% joe  i used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries  then he got brought out by obama out of the trash heap  became vice president  but we've now named him very slow  sleepy joe  very slow  he's gotten slower and slower  i'm afraid if he gets a nomination  he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked hillary  in fact  i don't even think that sleepy joe will get it  but many people are running  so  you know  it's so early  i don't want to talk about their campaign  oh  did you hear beto  beto  did you hear beto  beto  oh  that poor bastard  well  poor  pathetic guy  he was pathetic  remember the arms a-flailing  remember that  you know  he ran against ted cruz  ted cruz won  he spent almost 100 million dollars  and ted cruz窶ｦ and i helped ted  and we campaigned together  and it was good  but i used to watch him  then when he came onto the really big stage  this crazy stage  i noticed he was flailing with the arms  and he was standing on tables  he was standing on countertops  i said  ""does he ever stand on the floor and speak "" but he's waving his arms and going crazy  and i said  ""what the hell is he doing  what is he on "" and do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this  anybody that says he was born for this  they're in trouble  i used to have guys come into my office  ""sir  i'm the greatest salesman  nobody can sell窶ｦ"" you know  the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman  usually they're not a very good salesman  it's true  it's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk  that you don't know about  they're the ones  but beto was nasty  and he said that he was born for it  like he was born from heaven  he came down  and if that's the case  some really bad things happen  because he made a total fool out of himself  and he came out of texas  the great state of texas  he came out of texas  a very hot political property  and he went back as cold as you can be  so he was a nasty guy  but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of texas  right  he was against religion  he was against you having a gun  and he was against oil  so you come from texas  you don't like religion  you don't like oil  and you don't have guns  i don't know  that's not a good combination in the state of texas  that's not good in mississippi  either  i don't know it's that good anywhere  nah  he went back home to texas  and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time  it's amazing how cold you could get so quickly  but he was a nasty guy  but in the twist窶ｦ oh  alabama  love alabama  i love alabama  i love alabama  it's a great place  but in the very twisted and corrupt world of adam schiff  after beating the entire political establishment  and that means bush and that means clinton and that means obama  they have me supposedly saying to myself  ""well  let's see  i got a guy named sleepy joe biden  how do i beat him  how do i beat him  how do i beat this guy  he's such a great "" clinton  she was easy  right  obama was easy  the bush dynasty was  but sleepy joe  i'm worried about  right  so then i said to myself  ""gee  i guess there's only one way  let's call up ukraine for help  these people are sick  these people are sick  now  these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they'll put it  because they're so damn dishonest  and they'll just say- 窶ｦ ""let's use ukraine for help "" that's what they're going to say  and they won't show the laughter  and they won't show the sarcasm  and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth  it's a disgrace  but we say it anyway  and here's the good news  the people get it  so they have a brand new president in ukraine  good guy  by the way  and i call a brand new person  a man i have no idea who he is  and i'm on a phone  right  and i know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country  many people listen  and i'm on the phone  and they want me to say to this brand new president  just got there  called to congratulate him  ""please  could you help me please "" i don't know who he is  i didn't know his name until i looked down the card  i see  and he's a nice guy  and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because ukraine has tremendous corruption problems  and one of the reasons i held up money  very important  corruption  but the other reason窶ｦ why isn't germany and france and uk and all of these european nations that are right there窶ｦ why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do  why is it always the united states  so i made this call  had this wonderful call  and the transcript proves it was  as i said  perfect  it was perfect  it wasn't like almost窶ｦ it was perfect  it was totally appropriate  i made it at the behest of people to say  ""could you call and say hello "" now i'm an honest person  anyway  but do you think  when i'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country  that i would say something improper when i know there are so many people listening on the line  many people  whoever the hell wants to listen  they listen  and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people  and remember  the new president of ukraine is speaking to the united states of america  the president  i guarantee he's got a lot of people listening  too  these people are sick   no pressure  they must think we're nuts  to be honest  it's all a phony deal  this whole impeachment scam  to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections  maybe the greatest 窶ｦ i mean  let's give george washington credit  but everybody expected he was going to win  that we've ever had  so my phone call  which was totally perfect and appropriate  and if you want to read the transcript  you see how perfect it was  but they don't quit  but what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy joe  so i quote  ""i said"" 窶ｦ let me act like him  i've got to speak really slow though  and 窶ｦ ""i said  窶郎ou're not getting a billion ' i looked at them and i said  窶露'm leaving in six hours  if the prosecutor isn't fired  you're not getting the money  you understand  you're not getting the money '"" then he goes  at the end 窶ｦ i didn't know he had this kind of energy  he goes  ""well  son of a bitch  he got fired "" you know  in a certain way  i was impressed because  i mean  i didn't think he had the energy  the brain power  it's turned out he doesn't  by the way  he's dropping like a rock  when you're at 1%  there's always a reason  he should be there fairly soon  as you know  the ukrainian prosecutor that biden got fired after threatening to withhold  i think it was  1 billion or something in aid  was the prosecutor investigating his son's company  that was paying hunter biden  a guy just got thrown out of the navy 窶ｦ he was paying them millions of dollars  even though  working for an energy company  he had no experience with energy  he knew less about it than this young 窶ｦ how old are you  six  this young  beautiful person in front of me  six  and this young six-year-old is smarter  so i think i'd basically go with her  so what is it all about  it's called a payoff  but you know what  the fake news  they apologize  i watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings  anderson cooper  well  the hatred  i mean  between him and fredo  you've got fredo and 窶ｦ that's cuomo  fredo  i call him fredo  like from the movie  now i watched anderson cooper and i watched him apologize for even asking the question to biden  the good news is biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about  remember biden said  ""i don't know these people  i don't know them  i don't know them ""  we're dealing with life  right  he never spoke to him  unfortunately  the next day 窶ｦ in the world of the internet  in the world of smart people 窶ｦ that's why i like beto  he wasn't smart  couldn't handle it  i told my wife  i said  ""see  it's not so easy "" i told our great first lady tonight  who people love  they love her  when beto quit  he quit like a dog  when he quit i said  ""see  people think this is easy  this isn't easy "" but it just worked out that way  but biden said  ""i never met the people  never met the gentlemen "" unfortunately  in about 10 seconds  a picture came out where they're playing golf together  but he never met him  so now you'll ask him  he'll say  ""no  we played around a golf  we were together for three hours  i never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions "" oh  no  no  no  窶ｦ well  they might be watching us  i guess they do watch us  he used to interview me  he was so nice  prior to running for politics  he was so nice to me  it was like they were love fests  but i don't want anything to do with him  they were love fests  what a thought  he's weak  he's a weak person  but they're all weak  but let me just tell you something  we need honesty with our media  we need honesty  because the new york times  the washington post 窶ｦ and by the way  i don't know  you probably read it  we threw them out at the white house  we don't show them anymore  if somebody wants to go and buy them  we threw them out  and they came into my office and then i got to get back to this guy  where's hunter  where's hunter  we had a tee shirt made  ""where's hunter  where's hunter "" poor hunter  he then came out  he did the morning show  that was the last we've seen of hunter  that wasn't good  the morning of his father's very bad debate  but it's  where is hunter  but before i say the final thing on hunter and then we put him to rest for a while  we got rid of the washington post and the failing new york times  we got rid of them  right  we don't have them in the white house  i said  ""no  you could 窶ｦ people can go out and buy them  but we don't"" 窶ｦ we used to have them stacked up  and i'd go in and i'd see a meeting with my people and they're dealing with china  south korea  or somebody  and i'd go into these offices  i'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place  the washington post  and the new york times  i keep trying to figure out who's worse  and one day it's the times  one day it's the post  it's like top each other  they're so bad  it's so phony  in my opinion  it's virtually corrupt  i've never seen it  you never have a good story  i mean  even when we got al-baghdadi  the washington post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric  where did that come from  the other thing  if obama would have done it 窶ｦ because  look  this guy built isis  the caliphate  it was the size physically of ohio  the state of ohio  the great state of ohio  that's a big  lot of land  7 million people  and they were the ones  the orange jumpsuits  i called a lot of the parents after we did this and i talked to them and they were 窶ｦ how can you be happy  but they were so thrilled that we got this animal  they were so thrilled  but you know what  and you know what  we don't do it for 窶ｦ we do it because it's right  that story was a massive story  that was the biggest  maybe the biggest  one of the biggest  ever  bigger than anything  that story disappeared so fast  done  and that's okay  i didn't do it for the story  i did it because it's the right thing to do  but if i were a democrat  they'd be talking about that story for weeks  with me  they don't even want to 窶ｦ they actually played it down  and actually  and i'm happy about this  conan the dog got more publicity than me  and i'm very happy with that  i'm very 窶ｦ conan is incredible  and conan's coming to the white house in a few weeks  but it is true  did you ever see a story disappear so fast  i mean  if obama had that story  that thing would be going on for another seven months  they'd be talking about his bravery  oh  so bravery  but again  142 judges he gave us  remember that  how can you be a great 窶ｦ they always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges  we got two supreme courts  great ones  great judge  gorsuch and kavanaugh  great judges  by the way  did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-justice kavanaugh  did anybody ever  was any human being by these people  these horrible  horrible people that we have to deal with  anyway  just to finish  so hunter then goes to china  now i'm dealing with china right now  they don't like me too much  they dream about the day when somebody else 窶ｦ and would they like to have 窶ｦ how about this  you give this son  who has zero experience with investing  too  you give him  1 5 billion to invest  meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars  and the biggest guys on wall street can't get it  he walks out with  1 5 billion  and then there are other places also  i understand  folks  it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is  it's a payoff  it's a payoff  and how would you like to have sleepy joe  with the son getting all of this money from china  become president and take over the china deal  they are not liking me  they had the worst year that they've had in 57 years  their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now  billions and billions of dollars  we're taking billions and billions of dollars  and you know what we're doing with some of it  just a small portion  but 100%  they're taking care of 窶ｦ our farmers got  16 billion last year and  12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers  because they know the farmers love trump and trump loves the farmers  so they targeted them and they brought the  16 billion down to practically nothing  and they thought our farmers would say  ""oh  we don't like trump "" they did just the opposite  they said  ""we know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years "" but i said to him  i said to secretary of agriculture  sonny purdue  a great guy  i said  ""sonny  how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product "" he said  ""sir   16 billion "" i said  ""good  i'll make it up "" and we're going to have a lot leftover  so we will have  pretty soon  over  100 billion in money paid into the united states treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents  they only took  they only took  so when i said to the farmers  ""we're going to send you  16 billion  and it's already been sent  and it's been split into  12 billion the year before "" i mean  think of that   28 billion  i said  ""compliments of china "" and we had a lot left over  not bad  right  not bad  you think obama would do that  i don't think so  you think hillary would do that  i don't think so  you think sleepy joe would do that  i don't think so  he wouldn't know what you're talking about  on tuesday  the proud people of mississippi will send democrats a clear message  it's very important for this reason  as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst  but you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption  they're corrupt  adam schiff is a corrupt politician  you know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that i said it  i said  ""oh  i'm going to sue him "" they said  ""sir  i'm sorry  you can't "" he's got total immunity because he made it in congress  can you believe this  but here's the good news  at least we have a forum  we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on  a bunch of phony people  but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make tate reeves your great  new republican 窶ｦ right  republican governor  right  hey  he's a great guy  too  and all i know is he's loved and respected by your current governor  because phil is some piece of work  phil is so confident  i wanted phil to run for a certain office  then i wanted him to do something  i've tried to get him  but some guys are confident  phil said  ""no sir  i've been doing this all my life  i love the people "" he built the most beautiful african-american museum  phil  he's the greatest  but he built the most beautiful 窶ｦ but he's got confidence  and he said  ""no sir  i'd been doing it  i don't really want to do that "" in other words  he said  ""that's enough "" 窶ｦ oh  we love our police  right  i love our police  we love our police  he'll oppose sanctuary cities  which is just terrible  they're terrible  and tate will always defend your second amendment  so tate's running against a liberal democrat named jim hood  now all i know about jim hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked hillary clinton and barack hussein obama  isn't that nice  he wanted obama to win so badly and then he wanted hillary to win  and that's not the kind of guy we need here  not in mississippi  he's supported by extreme leftists like stacey abrams  who  by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of georgia  brian kemp  and they came in with 窶ｦ oh  they brought them all  they had president obama  they had michelle obama  they had oprah winfrey  they came in  and all he had was donald trump  and we won  we won  fairly easily  but stacey abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote  do you believe this  i mean  some of these people  they want to give them education  they want to give them this  they want to give them free healthcare  they want to give these people  that come into our country illegally all benefits  and he opposed our travel ban  which is so important that we won in the united states supreme court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country  and jim hood went to the united nations and opposed your right to self-defense  if you don't want a far left democrat running mississippi 窶ｦ wait a minute  how's this guy  i can't believe this is a competitive race  it's embarrassing  i'm talking to mississippi  i'm talking to mississippi  i can't believe it  i don't think that he's going to be the right guy  i think the guy that you want is tate reeves  he's going to be fantastic  he will be a great  great governor  tate  come on up  tate  thank you  tate  tuesday  go out and vote for tate  he'll never let you down  and don't kid yourself  your second amendment is under attack  but not with him  it's under attack  so we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly  and i've sort of said it a lot  but he's been a great governor and he loves your state  he loves the people of this great state  governor phil bryant  where's phil  come up  phil  come up  oh  he's central casting  look at him  come here  phil  thank you  phil  thank you  thank you  my phil  what a job  what a great job  you have to continue that whole thing going forward  so another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine  whenever there's a problem  he's there  he's always there  he'll be right at the front  he is tough  he is smart  he's brilliant  actually  and he loves this state and he loves you people  senator roger wicker  roger  thanks  roger  thank you  roger  and somebody  i'll call her up because  believe it or not  she's running with me  she just ran  i said  ""cindy  you just ran  you just won "" she said  ""no  i have to do it again "" she's running in 2020  i thought she'd have six years  i said  ""cindy  it's only like a year "" cindy hyde-smith  she's incredible  she's tough and smart and strong  and she's with us all the way

election  under the previous two administrations  we lost 60 000 factories in our country  under my administration  we've already added nearly 10 000 new factories  and many more are coming in as we speak  to get relief to working families  we passed massive tax cuts on average  2 000 to  2 500 per family  bringing almost  1 trillion back home to our shores  what's happening  you couldn't get the money  the big companies  they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint  they brought back almost  1 trillion now because of us  all put to work  we slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations  and we ended the war on american energy  we are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world  for decades  you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals  mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization  two of the worst deals ever made by our country  100 000 mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that  and that's awful  and a big price to pay for washington's disloyalty to the american worker  that's what it was  it was disloyalty  stupidity  corruption  lots of reasons  but now you finally have a president who is loyal to you  and i am  i'm a fighter for your jobs  for your wages  your factories  your families  and your dignity  we're stopping china from ripping us off  we're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the united states where we lose our money  we lose our wealth  we lose our jobs  we close our factories  that's not happening anymore  it's reversed  we were the sucker country for years and years  but we are not the sucker country anymore  and they all know it  we're replacing nafta 窶ｦ and that was a disaster  nafta 窶ｦ with the brand new us  mexico  canada agreement if nancy pelosi will ever put it up to a vote  which is questionable  nervous nancy  she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory  she's very busy doing other things  having fun  the usmca will be a massive victory for mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for mississippi auto workers  manufacturers  and everybody else  it's a great agreement  about time we got rid of nafta  the do-nothing democrats need to stop their madness and pass the usmca right now  the last administration's horrendous trans-pacific partnership would have destroyed the us auto industry  but i proudly  first thing  withdrew from that job-killing calamity  under our policies  toyota has just announced a  170 million investment in mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility 窶ｦ did you ever hear of this place 窶ｦ blue springs  blue springs  before my election  our leaders used the great american middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world  we take care of other people  we take care of other countries  but we don't take care of our own  they knowingly decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries  they deployed our military to protect 窶ｦ think of this 窶ｦ immensely wealthy nations  subsidizing their welfare states with your money  i ask those wealthy nations now  i respectfully the other day said to the king of saudi arabia  ""king  we're going to help you  but you've got to pay "" and he was great  no  he was great  he was great  he said  ""but nobody has ever asked before "" i said  ""but i'm asking "" and billions of dollars will come in  and we're protecting a great ally  we have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things  but we said  ""you're very wealthy  you have to pay "" and they're going to pay  and that's true with many countries by the way  that's true with many countries  they never respected us  they could never believe it  i said to one country 窶ｦ i have great respect for the prime minister of japan  i said to prime minister  i said  ""how did you get away with this for so long "" and he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen  we're protecting 94 countries  ask china  ""how many countries are you protecting president xi "" and they look at me like  ""what a stupid question  we protect one  china "" you ask president putin  ""how many countries are you protecting president putin "" and he looks and he goes  ""russia "" you ask other countries 窶ｦ we're protecting at least 94  in fact  so many they can't even tell me  i've been trying to get an answer for four months  so many they can't even tell  it's crazy  but it's all beautiful the way it's happening  a lot of good things are happening  but these same politicians poured precious american blood and treasure into the sands of the middle east while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay  our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you  to take your money  to take your jobs  to redistribute your wealth all over the globe  wherever they wanted it  but i don't like that  i don't like that  the great sellout has ended  and it ended the day i took the oath of office  that was quite a day  after years of building up foreign nations  we are finally building up our nation  we are finally putting america first  our policy of never-ending war  regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of american interests  it is the job of our military to protect our security  not to be the policemen of the world  proving the wisdom of this approach  we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in northern syria without spilling one drop of american blood  not one drop  actually  i have to be honest  one soldier stepped on a nail  that's true  i said  ""don't tell the press that because they'll say  but one soldier stepped in a nail "" i said  ""how bad was it "" ""it's okay "" i said  ""don't mention it please "" they always like to mention exactly what happened  you can take it a little bit low key  stepped on a nail  not a drop of blood  and we don't have to defend the borders between turkey and syria  they've been fighting for 1000 years  but what we do is we did keep the oil  if you don't mind  we kept the oil  we kept the oil  and we'll distribute that oil  we'll help out the kurds  and we'll help out other people  we'll also help out ourselves if that's okay  past leaders  foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very  very dangerous war zones  then they demanded that american citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions  i don't think so  i don't think so  we did not fight them over there only to invite them over here  we don't want to do that  to protect our communities  my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures  toughest ever that we've ever had  no issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the democrats  they want open borders  which mean crime  they want sanctuary cities  which means crime and drugs and death  after bleeding the middle class dry  democrats threw open our borders to the world  flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels  republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities  we are now building a wall  we're building it  we're building it  and you think that was easy  the democrats  they didn't want that wall  i got money for everything  but when it came to the wall  not 25 cents  not 25 cents  but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here  we took it from there  or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases  we're winning cases now  winning a lot of cases  but the wall is going up rapidly  it's going up rapidly  and this is a very serious wall  this is the exact everything they wanted  i went to the border patrol  incredible people and ice  incredible people  tough people  they love our country  and i said  ""give me the specifications for the wall "" they said  ""well sir  we'd like steel  but would also like concrete and would also like rebar "" i said  ""well  what do you want  which one "" so i did all three because it's a different form of cutting  you can cut through steel  but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar  we got it all  ""and we also need see-through  sir  got to see who's on the other side "" that makes sense  right  not just concrete  it's more expensive what we're doing  but we're giving and we're building 窶ｦ we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year  it's going up fast  in all the right areas  in all the right areas  that was a tough one  and the army corps of engineers is building their hearts out  they're great  great people  we believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country  and thanks to our tireless efforts on the southern border  tough place  illegal crossings have dropped 60% since may  and we are faster than ever securing the southern border  and soon it will be  when the wall is completed  secure like it's never been before  and i want to thank the country of mexico  they right now have 27 000 soldiers on our borders  27 000  you know what that is  and they are keeping people out  and i want to thank the president of mexico  he's an excellent person  great man  and we appreciate it  and the reason is that our democrats won't even approve things called loopholes  they're loopholes  that's a horrible name  right  that means it's a loophole  that means you can come in illegally and lots of things  catch and release  you catch them  then you've got to release them  by law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release  it's crazy  but we could end this in 15 minutes  but they don't want to do it  they don't want to do it  they're obstructionists  they're colluders  and we can't let it happen  that's why you have to go with tate reeves  tate's going to send a big signal  by the way  it's a big signal  it's great for you  he's going to be a great governor  it also sends a big signal to these radical left  crazy democrats  it's very important that tate wins  very important  we're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like mississippi  which has banned sanctuary cities because phil bryant said  ""we're not going to have them "" and roger wicker said  ""we're not going to have them  and cindy said  ""we're not going to have them "" democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets  if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice 窶ｦ and they are heroes  i wouldn't want their job  ms-13  they walk right into those nests 窶ｦ they call them a nest 窶ｦ and they start swinging  you never saw anything like it  i'll say  ""you know what  better you than me "" let's see who would do good  he'd do good  that guy  that guy would do good  most of you wouldn't do too good  no  i mean  these guys are tough guys and they love our country  who would do it  they're moving thousands of people from ms-13  these gangs are the worst people  these people  these are not human beings  you know  i said that once before and this crazy nancy pelosi said  ""how dare you say they're not human "" you ever see these people  and they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun  and then i have to defend myself when i say they're animals  but you know what  i never changed  i didn't say  ""oh  i'd like to apologize  i'd like to apologize  crazy nancy "" and you got to look at her district in san francisco  she's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff  take a look at what's happening to the great city  once  of san francisco  it's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods  nancy pelosi  go home and fix your district  nancy  go home and fix your district  go home and fix your district  if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice and border patrol  vote for tate reeves  tuesday  got to get out  you got to get out  got to send the signal  let it be a big victory too  the democrat party has never been more extreme  you know that  than it is today  the democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate medicare  i will always protect medicare for our seniors  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  always  we'll always take care of them  virtually every democrat also now supports late-term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth  well  the governor of virginia executed a baby  remember that whole thing  after birth  after birth  some people never heard of it  he said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother  nobody ever heard that  that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late-term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  the american dream  nobody has done more for the african american community than the republican party  and we're also the party of abraham lincoln  we can't forget that  people forget  abraham lincoln  honest abe  to lift up distressed communities  we created opportunities zones  so incredible  so successful  including 100 new opportunity zones right now in mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix  and tim scott  i give him so much credit from the great state of south carolina choices  they can go out  get a doctor  we pay the bill  and they don't have to wait six weeks  four weeks  two weeks  we had people waiting in line  they weren't very sick  by the time they saw the doctor  they were terminally ill  now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans  the great rebuilding of the american armed forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in biloxi and gulfport and jackson and starkville  and roger has been fantastic  and cindy hyde-smith has been fantastic  thank you  thank you  thank you  to protect america's security  i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal  it's not the same country anymore  nothing's easy  but it's not the same  and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  for years you watch as your politicians apologize for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america  and we are standing up for the people of mississippi  the next step to victory begins on tuesday right here in your great state  with your support we will show the corrupt democrats that the american people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history  and you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high  it's 窶ｦ i will tell you something 窶ｦ if we didn't win this election  that stock market would be in one-half  it was heading in the wrong direction  it was going to fail  and if they ever did anything bad  if they ever do anything bad to us  if they ever succeed in their wildest dream  which will never let them happen  that stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before  and you will not be happy with your 401ks like you're happy right now because they don't know what they're doing  they don't know what they're doing  and i'd like to speak well  but the leadership  they have no clue  they're just very vicious people  actually  they're sort of mentally violent people  but we've got it under control  it always helps when you didn't do anything wrong  i always say  ""how do you impeach a president who didn't do anything wrong "" so we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new republican governor to jackson  on tuesday  you're going to get out and you're going to vote  and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up  you're going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late  tell your boss i said it was okay  i will give you a pardon if i have to  i'll give you a one-hour pardon  but with your help  we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work  dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity  together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  and you have great congressmen here and i'll tell you  i want to appreciate it  fellas  warriors  you're warriors  you are warriors  what was it  196 for and nothing against  right  that doesn't happen with republicans  it doesn't happen  i always complain  i always say the democrats are lousy politicians  they have lousy policies  open borders  sanctuary cities  but they have one thing  they stick together and they're vicious  the republicans have great policy  in many ways they're better politicians  but they're not as vicious  thank you  darling  i appreciate it  they're not as vicious  but they have a tendency to split apart  the democrats don't seem to have any mitt romneys  we do  we do  i don't know  maybe he'll get better  maybe he'll get better  we'll see  we'll see what happens  maybe he'll get better  just let it be fair  but they don't have that  we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful  beautiful words  窶弄ade in the usa ' made in america  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america  can you believe that  within 10 years it will be over  when they told me that  i said  ""that's incredible "" we're going to end the aids epidemic within 10 years  it's funded  nobody would have thought we could do that  but we're doing it  we'll have it ended in america in 10 years  the aids epidemic  who would've thought  we will defend privacy  free speech  free assembly  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we

32,28,Jan,2020,datasets/Wildwood,"thank you  thank you  i love new jersey and i'm thrilled to be back right here in the garden state  thank you  the garden state  together we're achieving historic victories for new jersey families  you see it every single day  the new jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time  more people are working today in the state of new jersey than ever before  i have to tell you more people  almost 160 million  are working right now in the united states  that's the highest level of employment in the history of our country  a lot of countries aren't doing so well  just so you understand  tomorrow we will replace the nafta nightmare  one of the worst trade deals ever in history  with the incredible brand new us-mexico-canada agreement  the usmca  a massive win for new jersey workers  new jersey farmers  new jersey union people  new jersey manufacturers and everybody  weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with china that will boost new jersey exports and defend new jersey jobs   250 billion coming in  oh that's going to be so nice  we're restoring america's industrial might like never before  they're all coming back  they want to be where the action is  after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military  thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors  the greatest warriors in the world  the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder  and leader  al-baghdadi is dead  weeks ago  at my direction  the us military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist qasem soleimani  soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans  and actively planning new attacks  but we stopped him cold  yet washington democrats  like crazy bernie sanders and nervous nancy pelosi  they opposed our action to save american lives  they oppose it  they oppose it  you know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly  the legs  the arms  wiped out  no legs  no arms  soleimani loved that  that was his weapon of choice  we didn't like him  he's not around anymore  well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the congressional democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes  crazy witch hunts  and deranged partisan crusades  it's all they know how to do  the do nothing democrats  they have spent the last three years  and probably even before i came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady  trying to overthrow the last election  we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election  we are going to have a victory that's even greater than 2016  this november we are going to win back the house  we are going to hold the senate  and we are going to keep the white house  the american people are disgusted by the washington democrat 窶ｦ you see it  you see it  which is worse  the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from russia  but we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered independents  democrat voters  today i had the best polls that i've ever had since being elected  the best we've ever had  remember i used to go over polls  but i only used to talk about them when i was doing well otherwise i wouldn't  we had our best polls  americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left socialists  i never saw anything 窶ｦ what's going on in this country 窶ｦ what's going on in this country  really the democrat party is the socialist party and maybe worse  voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the republican party with wide open arms  the republican party is doing great  we are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism  enough of their socialism  and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams  he's had enough  i tell you he really is  he's a brave guy  he just said  "" i'm not doing it  i'm not doing it  it's a hoax  it's a scam  i'm not doing it "" we called him  ""you're our kind of guy  let's go "" it didn't take much because he believes like we do  we are truly honored to be here with the newest republican member of the house of representatives  your great congressman  jeff van drew  i have to tell you a few weeks ago jeff was one of the few brave and principled democrat lawmakers  in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime  who stood up to the house democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now  they can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election  it's not happening folks  it's not happening  jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party  and to stand tall in defense of our constitution  our freedom  and democracy itself  i just want to 窶ｦ i have to tell you  i've gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks  he's a great guy  he's a brave guy  he shares our values  he supports lower taxes  not bad  they want to raise your taxes  how did that work jeff  how did you get elected with that one  less regulation  a strong national defense  he loves our military  loves our vets  and police  he is a tireless champion for the state of new jersey  he loves your second amendment  which is under siege by the democrats  jeff  it's an honor to be with you  please  please  thank you  thank you man  we have tens of thousands of people outside  if anybody would like to give them your place please let us know  but we have thousands and thousands  tens of thousands  jeff gave me a number  he said  ""175 000 people signed up "" is that a fact  175  i think he's on his way  i think he's on his way  thank you jeff  great job  thank you jeff  thank you jeff  it's been a little bit of a story  you see the fakers back there  fake news  fake  you know if another candidate has 1 000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd  if they have 10 000  like pocahontas went into central park in new york  this young men could have 10 000 people  you know that  in central park  she had 10 000 people like in central park  i said  ""what's the big deal "" they made it  ""oh the crowds are so large "" jeff just told you he had 175 000 people sign up  seriously you have to see outside  they know because they have to follow  they're trailers  i call them trailers  but they're fake  they're fake  they're not honest  let me just tell you  so here's the story  so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time  we have tens of thousands of people outside  they never mention it  they never mention it  so maybe they will tonight  but that's an all-time record  this is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10 000 people or less  we set the all-time record  you know why  because for games 窶ｦ see the floor packed with people  for games you're playing ice hockey or basketball  so we broke the all-time record in this house  it's a wonderful house in a wonderful community  also in wildwood  like we're in the middle of winter  there is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer  those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically  but on june 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor  number one you have to get out and vote republican  get rid of these clowns  you have to get out and vote for really a brave man  what he did was incredible  jeff van drew  what he did was incredible  get out and vote  he's going to have a big victory  he's going to have a big victory  we're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine  people that i've known forever  your former governor who did a terrific job  chris christie  chris  great chris  great job  your wonderful republican state chairman doug steinhardt  what a job he's doing  thank you doug  thank you doug  my campaign's two great new jersey co-chairs and i think we'll play for the state 窶ｦ you know they all say republicans can't win  tell me why  they said  ""should you move this to the meadowlands "" i said  ""no  i want to be in south jersey  we want to be with our friends "" but we could have filled up the meadowlands arena two or three times  maybe we'll do it during the summer  should we do it during the summer  maybe  but two brave guys  two great politicians  people that love our state  state senators mike testa and joe pennacchio  joe pennacchio  thank you joe  thank you  thank you  two incredible new jersey natives  you've never heard of kellyanne conway have you say something  thank you kellyanne  i just want to thank republicans because what they've been doing is incredible  republican leadership in this country we're winning  winning  winning like never before  we're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part  a much stronger party  a much more inclusive party  we have a party that we love  we have a party that has the votes  we have a party like they've never had before  the republican party respected again  i have to say this  america is winning again and america is thriving again like never before  since the election we have created seven million new jobs  the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration  listen to this one  in united states history  that's a good fact  the lowest in history  thank you man  we have a great veteran up here and he said  ""we love you  we love you "" the veterans  are we doing good for the veterans  thank you  african american  hispanic american  and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country  ever recorded  women's unemployment is at a 65 year low  sorry about that  soon it's going to be historic  another couple of good months it'll be historic  65 years for women  in the eight years before i took office over 300 000 working age people left the workforce  they had no choice  in just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce  nobody believes it  including the fake 窶ｦ the workforce  nobody believes it including the fake news  if i would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this  the fakeness would have been hitting me  he's exaggerating  he's lying  pinocchio  pinocchio  the press is very dishonest  more than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year  which is a record  a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working  another record  under the trump economy  the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody  you don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom  it's very nice  it's about time  it's about time  it's been many  many decades  earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%  first time ever  since my election  the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased  listen to this  by 47%  three times faster than the increase for the top 1%  median household income is at an all time high  for president bush  in eight years it was  450  over eight years  think of this for a second  under president barack hussein obama  for eight years it was  975  so eight years  eight years  450  975 under your favorite president  and when you include the tax cuts  the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this  nobody's ever cut regulations  that's why all these jobs are being built  under president trump  for three years  the number is almost  10 000  and that's three years  and it's going up  it's going up very substantial  that's a big difference  new business applications in new jersey have just soared to a record high  and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare  they're off  they are off federal welfare  nobody would've believed these numbers  someday they're going to write the true story  our child tax credit alone is delivering  2 200 a year to 40 million american families  we have ended  so importantly for you  the war on american energy  the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  we don't need anybody else's energy anymore  it's so nice  what happened in the last three years with energy is incredible  but extreme liberals in washington want to shut down u s  energy  including through the so-called green new deal  close your factories  get rid of your cows  you don't have too many cows in wildwood  but if you do  they're gone  we will never sacrifice america's energy independence  took us a long time to get there  and we really picked it up over the last three years  what we've done is incredible  pipelines all over  pipelines are good  they're underground  they're good  environmentally sound  to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most  these are the communities that really have suffered  we created  with the help of a great gentleman from the state of south carolina  you know who i'm talking about  tim scott  right  senator tim scott  he's an incredible guy  he really is  he came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time  senator tim scott  opportunity zones  and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in new jersey  all over the united states  billions  and billions  and billions of dollars  and not government dollars  they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead  for decades  politicians ran for office promising to protect american workers  but then they went to washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash  and they shipped american jobs and dreams to other countries  they closed up your factories  they got rid of your jobs  they didn't have to pay taxes  globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories  steal our farms and ransack our communities  not anymore  not anymore  because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a president who puts america first  is that okay  the united states laws  listen to this number  and you know if it was wrong  the fake news would be all over me  and i've been saying it for three years  the united states lost 60 000 factories and plants  think of that  you wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals  because of bad leadership  during the 16 years of the two prior administrations  under just three years  my administration has now added 12 000 new factories  and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the united states  because that's where the action is  that's where they want to be  they are pouring back into our country  new plants and factories  you see them all over  i passed two of them coming in  brand new  beautiful plants and factories  they're pouring back in  this is where the action is  this is where they want to be  i see the leaders  they say  ""it's incredible what happened to your country "" i said  ""don't tell me that  we want you to have your companies build plants in new jersey and other places "" and that's what's happening  but on no issue have washington democrats thoroughly betrayed the american people than the issue of immigration  left-wing  radical  politician support deadly sanctuary cities  and remember  a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody  instead  they order them to be released into your community  what the hell is going on  what is going on  once set loose  these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent americans  right here in new jersey  your state's democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community  for example  cumberland county  we all know cumberland county very well  right  good luck with this one  they released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child  he is now at large  free to search for another innocent victim  they didn't want to give him to ice  and i want to thank ice  because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do  right here  another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in new jersey  the sanctuary jurisdiction of middlesex county defied the ice request to detain him  local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder  i could read these cases  honestly  i could read and state these cases to you all night  i could state these cases to you all night  no american should ever be hurt  harmed or killed because left-wing politicians  democrats  decided to shield and shelter窶ｦ look  look  wait  you have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail  you have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from  by the way  ice has removed thousands upon thousands of ms-13 gang members  the most brutal people  you don't want to do that job  maybe you do  a couple of tough people up there  anybody want to be with ice  you got a lot of tough people in new jersey  new jersey is different  i think new jersey is different  no  but these ice people  they love our country  they're proud and they're tough people  and they'll go right into a pack  they call it a pack and they start swinging  everyone's swinging or they end up standing up  that's the end of that  and you know what they do  they bring the ms-13 and many other gang members and other members back to el salvador  back to honduras  back to guatemala  back to mexico  i want to thank mexico because you know what's happening  right  thousands and thousands at this moment  27 000 soldiers from mexico  protecting our southern border  i want to thank the president  democrats stand for crime  corruption and chaos  republicans stand for law  order and justice  and say what you want  but those are the facts  we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members  we are literally taking them by so many  thousands and thousands  and we're bringing him back  thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border  we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row  we have the numbers down by 75% since spring  75%  we have ended catch and release and really  look  i had another party  i could get anything  if i wanted to spend money on anything  look with the military  we got two trillion dollars  right  more  two trillion  all made in america  right  everything  best planes  best missiles  best everything  made in america  if i wanted to build anything  the only thing they put the whole weight of their party  they didn't want us to have the wall  they knew it worked  many of them voted five years ago for a wall  they just didn't know how to get it built  i do  but what happened is through a series of court cases and other things  the money has won  and we are now building that beautiful wall  and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall  and by next year  we'll be over 400 miles  and shortly thereafter it will be complete  a lot of people were saying a year ago  ""he didn't build the wall yet  he didn't build the wall "" let me tell you  when you have the strength of a party that has the house  okay  hopefully they're not going to have the house for long  we'll have a wonderful new speaker  will get rid of nancy pelosi  nervous nancy  nervous nancy  we'll have kevin mccarthy who's been fantastic  we have to win back the house  but think of this  the wall  so many people were saying  ""build it "" well  it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the house  not easy  we did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military  the army corps of engineers anyway  but you know what  now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly  in all due respect to mexico  we like mexico very much  and we've gotten along great with mexico  and the president's a friend of mine  and i think he's doing a fantastic job  it's a tough situation  but mexico is in fact  you will soon find out  paying for the wall  okay  they'd hit you with that  now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by mexico  and it's an advantage for mexico  too  when you think about it  the wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities  what we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number  it's still anything that comes over is too much  but we're blocking it at a record number  i'm also very proud to report that we won a critical supreme court victory yesterday on immigration  we will now be finally able to enforce federal law  and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs  they were killing our country  killing our country  washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now  frankly  they're crazy  these people are crazy  they're taking their cues from socialists like bernie  left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million americans of their private health care plans  which many people like  the plans of every democrat running for president would demolish the economy of new jersey  where half a million new new jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies  we have them working at the companies  and we have people getting great health care  it's been so long  it's finally working and they want to destroy it  the republican party will never let it happen  we are saving your health care while the democrats are trying to take away your health care  take away your doctors  take away all of the good care that we fought  and we fought hard  and we're doing well and now we're doing better  by the way  some time prior to the end of the year  we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut  a very big one  but we're making health care better and much  much cheaper  we've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives  we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will  the republican party  pre-existing conditions  we saved it  we are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent  that's a big deal  and that will take effect starting in about two months from now  everything's transparent  you'll be able to see pricing  you'll be able to go and price other hospitals  other doctors  it's going to be an incredible thing  nobody believes i was able to do it  but we did it  we are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice  we are lowering drug prices  the democrats are increasing drug prices  we are fighting the lobbyists and special interests  we are serving you and how are we doing  we're doing good  right  but because of price transparency  we are getting it done  we're approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country  that means they come in  frankly  they're just as good as the big names  but they sell for 80% less in some cases  we are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds  we are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers  these are all things that we had to fight like hell to get  we're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records  which is a big deal for a lot of people  we are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs  you go home  you say  ""oh  i'm feeling better  the doctor was fantastic "" and then they send you a bill for  25 000  that's the end of that  all of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good  right  we are making companies compete for your business  we are repealing burdensome taxes  we have accomplished more than any president in the first three years of their term by far  not even close  we have provided health insurance options  60% cheaper than obamacare  and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease  hiv  pediatric cancer and alzheimer's disease  we're making so much progress  we have just passed a thing that i think is great  i never understood  for 45 years  they've been trying to get it passed  we've just passed a thing called right to try  you know what that is  so  we have the greatest doctors  the greatest technicians  the greatest labs in the world  and we'll have a drug that's looking good  but it's going to take five more years  and by the way  we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that  but it takes years to get it approved  you have people that are terminally ill  if they have money  they go to asia  they go to europe  they go all over the world looking for help  if they don't have money  they go home and they die  what we did is a thing called right to try  people sign something and they don't hold the country responsible  they don't hold the drug company responsible  it's called right to try  and they get the newest  and the best  and the latest medicine where it's looking good  but you're not going to have it for five more years  and you know why they didn't do it  because they didn't want to hurt anybody  except the problem is the people were going to die soon  i said  ""they're terminally ill  let them have it "" we sat down with a great group of leaders  republican leaders  and honestly  we had some bipartisan support and we got it done  they've been tried to do it for 45 or so years  we got it done  you have to see the results  and i've seen some of the results  some of the results are incredible  we've transformed veteran's health care  including through va choice  right  va choice  for 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice  i thought i had the greatest secret  you know  i haven't been doing this that long  so four years ago  i'm campaigning for president  everyone said  ""no  he's only having fun "" yeah  it's some fun  this is a lot of fun  right  but for 45 years- but for 45 years they've been trying to get it veteran's choice  so i come back one day  i say to my people  ""i have the greatest idea  i am so smart "" i am like the smart- i have an idea because the veterans are waiting online  they're waiting online for two weeks  three weeks  four weeks  ten weeks  some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors  too long  and i said  ""folks  i have the greatest idea "" all of my people  i say  ""i have the greatest idea  i'm so smart  here's what we're going to do  we're going to send all those people that can't see a doctor  we just can't get them to see a doctor  we're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed up "" right  so smart  but you see  i said i was smart and they looked back at me and they said  ""sir  we've known about that concept for 45 years  we just can't get it approved "" but i got it approved  and i got it approved about 11 months ago  and the va is doing fantastically well  our veterans are doing great  that was a big thing  that was a big thing  we also got accountability  where people could mistreat our veterans  do whatever they want  they could be sadistic  they could be so many other things  they could steal  they could rob  you couldn't do anything  you'd keep them  you couldn't do a thing  we got accountability  now you look at him  you say  ""get the hell out of here  you're fired  you're fired  now you can fire  they've let go of more than 8 000 bad people  we have reduced opioid deaths for the first time  and very substantially  in 30 years  and we are modernizing critical vaccines  we're doing a great job with vaccines  we are creating a pathway to buy drugs from canada  that are much  much cheaper  in florida  governor ron desantis came to me  he said  ""sir  this system is so bad "" and you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes  that's why you got to vote the house  you got to get us back the house  they say  ""sir  we can buy the drugs in canada for 50% less "" the same drug made in the same factory  made by the same company  50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in florida  or colorado  or new jersey  or wherever you are  this has been going on for a long time  no president has wanted to do it  you know how long it took me to make that decision  i said  ""if you can say 50%  or 25%  or 15% buy it  do it  go "" and i gave him authorization  ""do it "" we are protecting medicare for our nation's seniors  democrats want  and you know this  democrats want to raid medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants  and you know  we all have a heart  we all have a heart  but when you tell people to come into our country  like this clown governor of california  come into our country  they're all going to come  if they think they're going to get free education  free healthcare  they're all going to come  if you don't say it  they're not going to come  because who would even think this  virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion  ripping babies straight from the mother's womb  right up until the moment of birth  and that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god  democrats are now the party of high taxes  high crime  open borders  late term abortion  socialism  and blatant corruption  look at what's happening to their cities  los angeles  it's so sad  what you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless  san francisco  starting in new york  you could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by democrats  it's a disaster  they don't know what the hell they're doing  the republican party is the party of the american worker  the american family  and the american dream  republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race  religion  color  and creed  we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement  that's what it is  it's one of the greatest moments  it's probably the greatest movement in history  the 2016 election was probably  i mean you could say  the greatest election in the history of our country  and now we have to do it again to keep it going  it's like a giant tree  you plant it  but it takes time to grab on  we need this next election so badly  the good news is  it's much easier  because here i've done it all  i've achieved more than i promised  i never told you about space force  we got space force  i never told you about all of these things that we got  we are a big tent party in the true idea  it's big ideas  and we have a big future together  this country has tremendous potential  if we don't blow it  to give former prisoners a second chance at life  we pass bi-partisan  criminal justice reform  they came to me  they couldn't get it done  including many conservatives  and these people that i fight every day  they came to me  ""help  help  help  criminal justice reform "" i got it done  as soon as i got it done  they don't even want to mention my name  i got it done  i got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten  president obama tried  he couldn't get it done  president bush couldn't get it  they couldn't get it done  that's okay  they couldn't get it done  i got it done  i got it done  and after i got it done  and i mean solely got it done  and after i got it done they had news conferences  they're thanking people that i never even heard of  the only one they didn't think was president trump  and i got it done  but that's the way it is  that's why i always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it  we're fighting to give school choice to every child in america who needs it  during national school choice week  we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school  school choice  very important  democrats don't want that  to uphold the rule of law  we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written  and two great supreme court justices  two great ones  as we rebuild our military  we have authorized over  160 million to support our warriors at a place called  huh  mcguire air force base and fort dix  have you ever heard of those places  have you ever heard of those places  new jersey    160 million  two great places  i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem  and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  nobody else was going to do it  they've been trying to do that one for 52 years  for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new jersey  my friends  at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation  i really mean that  it's the survival of our nation  and if you would have had the other party winning this last election  instead of your market being up 72%  instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says  ""darling  you're the most brilliant person in history  for years  you've been losing your ass with 401ks  now you're making a fortune "" right  right  now you're making a fortune  i have people coming up to me all the time  i had one gentlemen come up  ""sir  thank you  sir  you've made me look so smart  my wife never respected me for anything  not anything  but now she thinks i'm a great investor  thank you "" 401k  if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for it to secure  then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020  we have to  and by the way  when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our nation  just so you understand  under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history  guess what you have  you have a business  you have a farm  you have a small business  no more inheritance tax  no more what we call death tax  so if you love your children  they won't have to mortgage the plant  they won't have to be mortgage the farm  as the expression goes  they won't have to mortgage anything  there's no tax  if you don't love your children  don't leave it to them and then you do have a problem  no  i'm only kidding  does anybody here not love their child or their children  because if you don't窶ｦ there's one man raising his hand  nah  that's a big thing  no more estate tax  no more death tax for your small farms and business  those are things that people don't even realize  only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all  and i never even knew the swamp was this bad  swamp is bad  bad people  a lot of bad people in the swamp  bad people in the swamp you thought this was going to be easy  right  a lot of bad people  together  we will elect a republican congress to create a fair  safe  sane  and lawful system of immigration  that's what's happening now  we will enact trade deals  the greatest deals ever made  that result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase ""made in the usa "" beautiful  for decades we had politicians that didn't care about that phrase  that phrase didn't mean anything to them  we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine  finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic  can you believe this  in america in 10 years or less  we've already started the process  and it could have been started sooner by the past administration  they chose not to do it  i chose to do it  think of that  ending the aids epidemic within 10 years that we've started  we will defend privacy  free speech  religious liberty  and the right to keep and bear arms  which is under seige  by the way  our second amendment is under siege  in virginia  they want to take your guns away  it's just the beginning  never going to happen as long as i'm president of the united states  that i can tell you  but above all  we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america  we support  protect  and defend the constitution of the united states  we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement  we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life  we believe that faith and family  not government bureaucracy  are the true american ways  and we believe that children should be taught to love our country  honor our history  and to always respect our great american flag  and we will always live by the words of our national motto  in god  we trust  thank you  everybody  thank you  very much  everybody  from morristown to vineland  and patterson to pennington  from camden to clifton  all the way down the shore to ocean city and sea isle and stone harbor  and right here in wildwood  new jersey  this has always been the home of

 that i can tell you  new jersey is the state where george washington led a die hard band of american patriots to victory at trenton  and princeton  and monmouth  in our glorious battle to win american independence  george washington  this is the state where generations of tough and strong new jersey craftsmen and dock hands  farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth  and we are making it greater and greater every day  it will never be better than what's coming  there'll never be anything like what we're doing  proud

33,8,Sep,2020,datasets/Winston-Salem,"well  thank you very much  thank you  thank you very much  it's a great honor to be in north carolina  we had great  great luck and great people backing us in north carolina  and i'm thrilled to be in winston salem with thousands of loyal  hard working american patriots  you are great people  great people  i don't know how many people here  but there's a lot  we said let's keep it down  they didn't do too good a job  but that's good  that's good  now these crowds  i tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm  beyond what we had four years ago in 2016  and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot  this is the most important election we've ever had  56 days from now  we're going to win north carolina  we're going to win four more years in the white house  this is a choice  and i must say  this is a choice for many  many decades  i don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference  this is the american dream and the other  i don't want to say it because i'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there  but the other is a basic disaster for our country  joe biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs  throwing open your borders  dragging us into endless foreign wars  along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like china  remember this  very simple to remember  if biden wins  china wins  it's as simple as that  so you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world  we were forced to close it because of the china plague that came in and now we've opened it  and by the way  your state should be open  your state should be open  any governor that does that  and even if you look statistically  it's you it's michigan  it's a couple of others  they're closed  new york  look what they're doing in new york  what they're doing to our beautiful new york  it's so sad  but you just take a look at what's going on in north carolina  they want to open  they want to open  they want to open in michigan so badly  they want to open  they want to have football  they want to have their schools open  and it's a shame what's going on  and i'll tell you what  on november 4th  every one of those states will be open  they're doing it for political reasons  they're doing it for political reasons  they think by hurting the economy  by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings  offices  they think by keeping them and hurting them  you're hurting the economy  our economy is doing phenomenally well  and it's not only is it a v  it's a super v  you see what's happened  we just had a jobs number come out  1 4 million  it's down to 8 4%  nobody thought that  8 4  so we had the greatest economy  we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it  we're opening it up  and we will have a great third quarter  it's going to be announced  by the way  just before the election  but we're going to have a great third quarter  we have unbelievable retail numbers  unbelievable numbers all over  and this is that super v  but next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically  unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen  and remember this  if biden wins the violent mobs  you see these mobs all over the place  they're biden people  they're biden states and cities  they're democrat states  if they win  the mobs win  you see these guys  they go around saying  yeah  i want your meal  give me that food  give me that  a woman sitting there  she wants to eat  and they come and they grab her food  they grab her drink  nobody's ever seen stuff like this  this is all that ideology  we're not going to let it happen  we're not going to let it happen  and in portland  you see what happened last night  they arrested over 50 people the first time  we said  either do it or what going in  we're going to have to go in  do it  let us go in  we're saying i spoke to the governor of oregon the other day  let us go in  i said  let us go in  we'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour  now the us marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody  you saw that  he killed a young man in the middle of the street violently  he had other charges against him  and i put out  when is he going to be arrested  and they went in about 15 minutes later  and i'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go  all they have to do is call us  it'll all be solved very quickly  they have to call them  but all of these places are democrat run places  radical left run places  they don't know what the hell they're doing  if biden wins  the rioters  arsonists and anarchists win  he said the other day  well  if i win  that doesn't mean that's going to stop  he doesn't  he will never stop  if they win  it's not going to happen  hopefully  because this is not like a second place crowd  let's face it  are you seeing  are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out  that's why he left  finally  he left his basement  he said we got problems  i don't think he knows that  but the people that manage him know it  they understand it  he doesn't  so i'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home  to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america  not to china and other countries  because if we win  america wins  you know that  you've seen that  over the last three and a half years  we've secured america's borders  fixed our broken trade deals  and they were broken like you've never seen  they weren't even broken  they were bad  they were bad from day one  rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military  obliterated the isis caliphate 100%  in fact  i got it down to 98%  remember a year and a half ago  i got it down to 98  and they all said  no  no  it's got to be a 100  i said  somebody else could finish  we want to get home  they said  no  you've got to finish it  so we took another two months  we finished it and we're bringing them home  we're bringing them home  these great  great warriors  people don't like it when i say that  secured american energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world  and now we are very simply  we're doing it again and we're on track to have  as i said  the best year we've ever had next year  you just had the best year  you just had the best year of the history of your state last year  we've created a record breaking 10 6 million jobs in the last four months  but if sleepy joe biden takes power  the economy will collapse  he won't even know the difference  how's the economy  not good  sir  we're in a depression  we are  what's that  joe biden  who spent 47 years shipping north carolina jobs to china and other countries  you know that  and i've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country  we've never had so many jobs  we're up to 160 million jobs  we were never anywhere close  we got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that  here in north carolina  voting is already underway  on november 3rd  americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government  set fire to a whole country  you know  when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago  i signed a very strong executive order  you want to knock them down  that's fine  but you go to jail for 10 years  it was amazing  it was amazing how that stopped  and then they said  well  we'll do it easily  we'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years  you know  they'd look at it  they'd say not worth it  10 years is too much  but the dc committee  did you see about that  they want to change the name of the washington monument  they want to get rid of the lincoln monument  jefferson monument  now  we're talking the big stuff  they finally hit the big time  took them awhile to get there  but i said that was going to happen  don't worry about it  you don't have a thing to worry about  if our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple america  they could hardly do better than the biden  kamala harris  kamala  remember kamala  she started at 15  she was supposed to win  problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four  it's like a free fall  you know what  people don't like her  nobody likes her  she could never be the first woman president  she could never be  that would be an insult to our country  biden wants to impose a  4 trillion tax hike  a ban on american energy  eliminate america's borders  confiscate your guns  he wants to get rid of your second amendment  we're going to be appointing very pro crime judges  but they want to destroy your suburbs  you know  the rule  the regulation that i just terminated  they want to build low income projects in the suburbs  they've been doing it  they've been destroying suburbs  we're not doing it anymore  somebody said suburban women  how's trump doing  but do you remember last time too  they said women don't like trump  i said  i think they do  i think they do  they said women don't  and then we did great with women  and remember that great  was that one of the greatest evenings ever  four years ago  that was one of the greatest  but one of the things they did  first of all  we did much better  now we're doing really well  african american vote  much better hispanic vote  much better  he did better with african americans than we thought  he did better with hispanic than we thought  he did better with asians than we thought  he did really well with women  what's this all about  ladies and gentlemen  and they said  donald trump is projected the winner of 2016  you remember that evening  was that the craziest  that was the craziest thing  and they thought  i think they didn't think it  but i'll tell you what anything we had then  we have much more now  they don't understand  they do understand it  they do  right  they understand it  look at that beautiful dress  and she wears that dress right through the middle of hollywood and everyone says  thank you very much  beautiful  like it  but they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the united states economy again  biden said the other day  well  if the experts told me  we're not shutting it down again  we don't have to  we learned about the disease  we did the right thing  we saved millions of lives  people don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting china  we put a ban on china  heavily infected  and biden was against it  three months later  he said he did the right thing  i have to admit  it's clear why both china and the flag burning rioters want biden to win  they know his policies will be the downfall of america and they know my policies will lift america to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before  that's what's happening  that's what's happening  and never forget  they're coming after me because i'm fighting for you  there's a lot of truth in that one  and they do come after me  they do come after me  they have more things to say about me  every day  it's something  they said  you see the plane where it is  sir  would you like to take the car  i say  why  i'm saying what  well  i heard you had a limp  i do  i don't know about a limp  i don't have a limp  hey  someday  i'm going to have a limp  i'll let you know when  you'll see it  no  they make this stuff up  they make it up  they make stuff  it's called disinformation  they give a phony deal out  they did it two days ago with the military  there's nobody that loves the military more than me  i was very lucky though  i had 15 incredible american patriots that came by and they said  he never said that  they were there  they were there  but they make up stories  horrible stories  many  many  hey  look  look at last time  the fake dirty dossier  it was all made up  and frankly  if the shoe was on the other foot  if it was on the other foot  you'd have many people  20  25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it  and it's a disgrace that it's taken this long  it's a disgrace that it's taken this long  and let me just tell you a little secret  obama got caught and so did sleepy joe biden  remember biden just sitting in the room saying  why don't you use the logan act on general flynn  look at general flynn  what he's going through for years  if that were ever reversed  i'm telling you  you'd have many people in jail for many  many years and it would have started three years ago  it's a disgrace  but let's see what happens  biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to american communities  and you know  he talks about like  well  he's going to do this  he's going to 窶ｦ he doesn't have any idea  he has no clue  he's going to do this  he's been there for 47 years  and he just really left  he left three and a half  four years ago  so he just left  but he's been there for 47 years  i'm going to do this  after 47 years  he's had a change of heart  this is the craziest election  this is the craziest 窶ｦ look  somebody said  what's the difference between crooked hillary clinton and slow joe  so the difference is the following  she's meaner  probably not as nice  i don't know  you can't get any worse than her  when you think  but the big difference is she's smarter than he is  okay  he's a nicer person  but he's not smart  he never was  not in prime time and certainly not now  the washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination  biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left  you know that  with crazy bernie and everyone  and by the way  you know who's further left than crazy bernie  kamala  kamala  kamala  you remember she left the race  sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory  they should be able to win in california  i don't know  maybe we'll make a play for that one too  but they picked somebody from california  i don't quite get it  but you always pick somebody that's hot  that's going up in the polls  going up  frankly  i'm not sure  i don't think i've ever said this  but probably hillary should have picked bernie sanders to be her running mate  right  because as crazy as it sounds  he was hot  he gave her a hell of a fight  a lot of people think he won and it got taken away  one thing about bernie  he's the greatest loser i've ever seen because look  any children here  no not too many  but they've heard it before  he got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again  biden got the nomination  he got the nomination  but if biden would have sat back and if elizabeth warren  pocahontas  you remember pocahontas  she finally faded  she faded badly  but if she would have dropped out on super tuesday  prior to super tuesday  bernie would have been the nominee  and i don't know who i'd rather run against  one is super left  the other one's had to become super left  one is competent  the other one is only half competent now and heading south  he's half competent and heading south rapidly  but the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the american middle class in the truest sense  that's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over  if you look at that  it's over the law abiding areas that we have  republican cities and towns are doing great  we're doing great  and we don't have crime and we don't have this violence  chicago over the weekend  many people killed  many people shot  shot  they're actually shot and killed  new york  the same thing  new york's gone through the roof  they were up 300% in certain categories  and you say  what's happening  and we want to send them in so badly  joe biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters  and you know  we call you peaceful protesters  you know why  because they have rules in these democrat run states that if you're campaigning  you can't have more than five people  they- that if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people  they did that for me  if you are going to church you can't go to church anymore  you can't go to church  you can't go to church  you can't do anything  you have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot  running down main street  if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do  you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people  my very brilliant consultants who i don't listen to too much  maybe i should  ""sir  please don't say law and order  that's too tough "" now in the meantime you look at these streets  people crazy  they say  ""say law and order but with safety "" i said  ""look  people get it  it's just law and order  is that okay "" we want law and order  they say  ""law and order and safety  sir  could you add the word safety  because it's 窶ｦ"" i said  ""i don't want to add "" it's sort of obvious  right  we want law  we want order  biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that america is racist  by the way i've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country  sheriffs in florida  ohio  texas  north carolina  all over the country  but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now  did you notice that  he sees what's going on  his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on  now he's starting to say  ""no  we need law and order "" no he didn't say that  did he  he'll never get to say that  can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party  you take a look at 窶ｦ you don't want to be dealing with the left  these people are stone cold crazy  you don't want to be dealing  meanwhile biden  he doesn't say a word about the thousands of african-americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in democrat-controlled cities  they're murdered by the thousands and they never  ever mention it  my heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities  not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down  next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful americans  remember this  these are biden supporters  and if he wins  they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there  you'll be taking your monuments down  you'll be taking your statues down  i'm not kidding  you'll be taking them down  you have to look at the d c  report  i'm just telling you  go get it  you wouldn't even believe it  it's too crazy to even talk about  but we're never going to give them a chance to do it  we're never giving them a chance  we're going to win  we're going to win big  this is a very important state  and by the way 窶ｦ by the way  when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots  when you get a ballot  say  ""well i wanted to go and vote  darling  i wanted to go and vote  why are they sending me those ballots "" there's something really 窶ｦ the only way we lose north carolina and a couple of others like nevada  we're doing great there  now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited  you have solicited and unsolicited  they're going to send out millions of ballots to you  people that never really thought in terms of it  now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot  that's a solicited ballot  it's okay  you have to go through a process  you have to sign the form  you get it  sending out millions of unsolicited ballots  make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts  make sure it counts  because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things  that's the only way as far as the eye can see  but they'll correct it  they'll say  ""he's wrong  it was 14 500  he's misrepresenting  he's misrepresenting "" now i was told we have 15 000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace  it's a wonderful thing  i actually think 窶ｦ i don't know if you agree  so we go to the arenas but because of china  the arenas aren't working out too well  right  you can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn  i will tell you  we're rounding the turn on that but because of that 窶ｦ so we said where because we have the same crowds  i think we have bigger crowds potentially  we were in new hampshire the other night  we had to turn away 8 000 people at an airport  we're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside  outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors  right  but they say it's very much different  so we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors  we're doing the hangars  but i really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago  it's pretty amazing  it's pretty amazing  we started off in new hampshire  we said  ""look  let's have 1 000 people "" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more  we're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed 窶ｦ two weeks ago  we landed in new hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and i mean it's really amazing what's going on  all over the country  it's amazing  it's amazing  it's a great thing  more support than we had four years ago because four years ago i said i was going to do this  i was going to cut your taxes  i was going to cut regulations  i was going to get right to try  i was going to take care of your vets  i was going to rebuild your military  i was going to do all these things and you said  ""i don't know  that's a lot of 窶ｦ"" you know what  i've actually done more than i promised  build a wall  build a wall  true  i've done more  for instance you never heard me say  you never heard me say  a lot of you were at various rallies  you never heard me talking about space force  we built  think of it  a new branch of the united states military  the united states armed forces called air force  i never talked about that  that's something we never talked about  i only figured that one out after i became president because i saw what russia was doing and what china was doing  i said we have to do the same thing  and if you think that was easy  that was not easy  that was not easy  it was very hard  but what we've done 窶ｦ you know the wall now is past 300 miles  it's exactly the wall that our great border patrol wanted  i was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here  boom  boom  you put it  ""sir  we have to be able to see through "" i said  ""all right  let's go  much more expensive "" i said  ""let's go "" so we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too  that's right  mexico is going to pay for it  what happens if they fight us  remember that answer  it's going to get 10 feet higher  remember that  what happens if they fight us on the wall  the wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now mexico and i get along great  in fact they have 27 000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country  can you imagine that  27 000  and i did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in  it was very simple  i said you got to do it and the president's been great  he's a friend of mine  he's doing a very good job  not easy  mexico's not easy  but he's doing a very good job  but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall  it's everything that the border patrol wanted  i gave them everything  i said  ""what else do you want "" it's wired for every single thing you could have  remember the democrats  ""we don't want a wall  we want drones flying "" oh that helps us a lot  drones  so you can watch everybody pour in to our country  right  biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail  just last week sleepy joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters  vandals  criminals and violent extremists without charge  now last night though  they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to  we said you have to and we told them about 窶ｦ we will federalize them  we'll do whatever you need and i spoke to the governor  it looks like they're finally  after 107 days  like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon  otherwise we're going in  the biden-bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide  now you got to understand  bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and i got a lot of bernie voters  i think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade  they understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off  they're ripping us off on trade  i agree with him on that  the difference is i know how to do something about it  they don't  they don't have a clue  they just know they're being ripped off  and a lot of bernie people feel that  that's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of crooked hillary which was a very nice thing  we appreciate it  we hope we don't lose it  because we've really implemented things  we've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for china  from china  and china's never given us  0 10  it's a one-way street with china  they haven't given us 窶ｦ we signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so i view that trade deal much differently than i did before  much differently  it's a great deal  they just last week  they ordered the biggest order of corn in history  the biggest order of soybeans in history  and i say just shows you though they're smart  very smart  instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more  we're not going to do business  no  instead they do the opposite  they give us the biggest orders 窶ｦ our farmers are very happy  our farmers are very happy  biggest order of corn  biggest order of beef  biggest order of soybeans  and i gave the farmers  28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by china and i gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the u s  treasury but nobody's ever done this before  nobody's ever done this before  with biden it's the reverse  his son goes  sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with  walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage  he'll make millions of dollars a year  and he has no experience at all  never happened before  biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists  my plan is to arrest them  so on november 3 america faces a very simple choice  do what you want  vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to  or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else  wait till you see the numbers  wait till you see the numbers  you know there was a poll that just came out  i think it was gallup  and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying  i said  ""that's a big number  right "" i think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out  and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered  in other words they're not lying about sleepy joe  they're lying about us  and i don't know if i'm supposed to love that or hate it  i don't know if it's an insult or not but i will take it  we don't give a damn  if that's the case  we have a virtual landslide going  we have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible  but you know what  fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word  we had the call perfectly and if i didn't have it  somehow with these people i guess i'd still be here if you want to know the truth  but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing  the republicans stuck together  and kevin mccarthy's done a fantastic job  he really has  with the exception of a half a vote from mitt romney  you can have him  he's not too popular  i want to tell you  he's not a very popular guy in utah  he's not too popular  so it was 52 5 to a half  he's a beauty  i'll tell you that guy  he couldn't get elected dogcatcher in utah right now  remember utah  they said it's too close to call  this was before the election  and they announced utah  the polls are closed  donald trump has won the state of utah  do you remember that like immediately  i won by a lot and there was some guy running  mcmuffin  mcmuffin  mcmuffin  he was supposed to be second  even hillary beat him  what a group  lieutenant governor dan forest  dan  get out and vote for him  get out and vote for him  okay  i'll tell you he'll be a great governor  he loves your state  he'll be a great governor  thom is going to be a great  great senator for another six years  we need them both and i hope you're going to do well  dan  i know you're really getting up there  it's getting very close  i'll be honest  if this governor that you have  i know him  you know we had to take our convention away  he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena  10  because it said one room 10  you're not supposed to have political rallies  i said  ""you know the money that your state is going to be losing "" but if this guy doesn't open up your state  because almost all of them are open now  if he doesn't open up your state  you have no choice  you're going to vote for him anyway but dan  you'll be so good  dan forest  go and vote  the republican nominee for north carolina attorney general  jim o'neill  jim  where is jim  thank you jim  thank you very much  good luck  got to be careful with those ballots  watch those ballots  i don't like it  you know you have a democrat governor  you have all these democrats watching that stuff  i don't like it  i look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless  really  if they're going to cheat  these big beautiful crowds  you could have 15 000  you could have 50 000  these crowds are meaningless  watch it  be poll watchers when you go there  watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do  because this is important  we win north carolina  we win  we're going to win florida  i just left florida  we're going to win florida  north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley north carolina  great  thank you michael  thank you  great job  and a very good friend of mine  a great guy  mick mulvaney  where's mick  oh  i didn't know mick was here  look at him  what a good guy  thank you mick  we have a lot of big shots over there i see but what do you think about a guy named mark meadows  chief of staff  we love mark  doing a great job  he's doing a great job  robert o'brien  robert  how many hostages have you and i negotiated to get back  not giving anything but we have a record of what  robert  50  50 and 0  we're 50 and 0 on hostages  we got them back  we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing  robert  thank you very much and thank you all for being here  mick it's good to see you  oh wait a minute  wait  it's a very  very outstanding senator  oh i'm lucky i got to see that  we love south carolina  right  come here  lindsey graham everybody  lindsey graham  lindsey and tim scott  two great ones  two great ones  they may be from a different state but they love you lindsey  that's good and tim is another one  so we have just incredible people in the party  we've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy  we passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations  more than any president in history whether it was four years  eight years or in one case more  regulations  and to keep family farms in the family  we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses  remember  that was a terrible thing  people were fighting for that  your family lost the farm  lost 窶 53]  no  but it was a terrible thing  you'd pass away and your kids would get the farm  they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive  they'd put big mortgages on the farm  they'd lose the farm  they'd lose the business  you don't have that anymore  i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe  the trans-pacific partnership was a disaster  for half a century  joe biden shook hands with blue collar workers  and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back  biden supported nafta  china's entry into the world trade organization  tpp  the south korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens  think of it  but the big deal is  he's changed  he's changed  ""after 47 years i've changed  i swear to you i've changed "" did you see him in the debates  he was not too good  but that's okay  he was better against bernie  something's going on there  i don't know  you know what i'm talking about  but he was better against bernie  but in the other debates  he was giving them everything they want  free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally  colleges  everything  now the new deal  under the new deal  they get lawyers  if they come in to our country illegally  we supply them with legal advice  you believe it lawyers  this is what we need  is more lawyers  this state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization  that's courtesy of biden and his friends  earlier this year  i kept my promise to north carolina when we ended the nafta nightmare and we signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law  it's been incredible  everyone said  ""impossible "" they all said it was impossible to get done  we got it done  and it's a great deal  and it prevents people  it prevents companies from fleeing your state  opening up in mexico or canada  making a product  selling it to us with窶ｦ it's such a disincentive to do that  now that was the thing that was most important to me  i used to hate when i'd see all these companies leaving our country  going to mexico in particular  but canada also  a lot of them going to canada and they'd make a product  everybody gets fired in our country  they close their business and they make the same product in a different country  they send it back to us  no tax at the border  no tariff  no nothing  it doesn't work that way anymore  i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging  plundering  ransacking  and rampant theft of north carolina jobs and us jobs  joe biden's agenda is made in china  my agenda is made in the usa  in the face of china's economic aggression  we provided a historic  28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers  i will always stand with american agriculture  these are the greatest people  the finest people  and we're not going to let others take advantage of them  for 20 years  for 20 years  you look at a chart  it's just been this way for 20 years  now  it's going back up  i mean  it helped that i gave you  28 billion in all fairness  right  if i didn't do that  and i took it all from china  it was very easy  if i didn't do that  i think you wouldn't have any farmers right now  really  it was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers  28 billion over two years  they got hit one year  16 billion  one year 12 billion  i said to sonny perdue  secretary of agriculture  great guy  an ex-farmer  governor of georgia for eight years  great guy  i said  ""sonny  how much are they being targeted for "" he said  ""sir   12 billion for the year before  and last year sir was 16 "" so i said  ""28  okay  that's fine "" i said  ""we will give them 28 billion  they were unfairly targeted "" and that was in order to get me  and by the way  china wants joe biden so badly  oh  they want窶ｦ and you know who else would like them very badly  iran would like them very badly  because i ended that iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1 8 billion  in cash  and you know what's going to happen  they're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes  their gdp went down 24%  nobody ever heard of that before  their country is in trouble  i don't want them to be in trouble  but they're going to wait till after the election  when i win the election  they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast  watch how fast it'll be  they're dying to make a deal  but they do want to wait  ""let's wait two months  maybe we'll get lucky  maybe we're going to get lucky and slow joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal "" no  there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal  we'll make a fair deal with them  but what obama did and biden did with that horrible iran deal  i ended last administration's war on american energy  biden has pledged to end production of american oil shale  clean coal  no fracking  wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters  we don't want to buy energy  we've done that for a long time  for decades and decades  we don't want to do that anymore  i like being energy independent  don't you  and i'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car  oftentimes it's below  2  you said  ""how the hell did this ever happen  thank you president trump "" right  thank you president trump and look at your electric bills  everything else  these guys  your electric would go up four  five  six times  the green new deal  it's called the green new nightmare  while i'm president  america will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent  it should be for many  many years to come  because the fact is  we don't have to be in the middle east other than we want to protect israel  we've been very good to israel  but other than that  we don't have to be in the middle east  we don't need窶ｦ there was a time we needed desperately  we don't need that anymore  we have more than they do  isn't that nice  after years of rebuilding other countries  we are finally building our country  america first  it's america first  to bring hope to our inner cities  i created opportunities zones  i worked with senator tim scott of south carolina  what a great guy  he has passed criminal justice reform  prison reform  delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama never did  or couldn't do  and biden  i call it obiden  o biden  it's too long to say obama and biden  just call it obiden  and before the china virus  we achieved the lowest african american  hispanic american  asian american unemployment rates ever recorded  and we're heading back to that level rapidly  biden spent the last 47 years betraying african american voters  he betrayed them  look at 1994  take a look at that  he betrayed them  what he did to them  he closed the factories in baltimore and sent them to beijing  they were all sent to beijing  so many people went there  they went to all parts of the world  but a lot went to beijing  he shattered the plants in chicago and sent them to shanghai  unlike the previous administration  under my administration we put america first  and actually  if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere  and nobody has been through what i've been through as president of the united states  nobody  they used to say abraham lincoln got the worst press  i said  ""there's no way he got worse than me "" but lincoln was very  very badly treated by the fake news  maybe in his case  it was real  i can tell you  in my case  it's fake  it's totally fake  but nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again  let's see what happens  we caught them cold  let's see what happens  but if we didn't have to窶ｦ that takes time  and energy  and all other things  31]  she could have said  ""okay "" she could have said  ""you got me "" but she said  ""i got set up by the beauty parlor owner "" who happens to be a trump person by the way  i like the beauty parlor owner  she said  ""i got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor  she set me up "" i said  ""how are you going to deal with putin  kim jong-un  and president xi of china "" no  it's terrible  she's always preaching about the mask  ""you got to wear the mask at all times  indoor  outdoor  when you go to bed at night  put the mask on "" i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african american community and when i'm reelected the best is yet to come  i'll tell you that  perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration  under my administration  we've achieved the most secure border in american history  now  i have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot  remember they said  ""walls are old fashioned  they don't work "" really  i always say  and i've said it four or five times  i'll say it again if you'd like me to  two things if you come back in a thousand years  2000 years  or 3000 years  if you're lucky enough  assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place  isn't it  but if you come back in a thousand years  there are two things  with all the computers  and all the everything changes every day  you invent a new cell  you invent a new laptop  everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it  right  two things that will never get obsolete  the wall and the wheel  right  the wheel and the wall  maybe i'm wrong  who knows  but i would say walls and wheels have a great future  we ended catch and release  stopped asylum fraud  and we've deported 20 000 gang members  including the radical ms-13  we invested  2 5 trillion in the united states military  all made in the usa by the way  we have the newest  finest military we've ever had  and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many  many decades  we passed va choice and va accountability which everybody said could not happen  and veterans satisfaction with the va has just reached 91%  the highest satisfaction level in history  i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal as i said  and i kept my promise and recognized the true capital of israel and opened the united states embassy in jerusalem  and then i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east peace for many  many decades  decades  even the new york times said that was an amazing achievement  do you believe that  i said  ""let me see that one "" now we did something that nobody thought was possible  man  it's israel  as you see  and as you've read  israel and uae  highly respected leader  mohammed  highly  highly respected  and now we have other countries in the middle east  they all want to come in  it's going to be a beautiful picture  going to be a beautiful picture  we killed the vicious founder and leader of isis  al-baghdadi  we killed him  why didn't biden get him k they were after him for eight years  they never got him  i got him  the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american crews  qasem soleimani  we got him too  soleimani  al-baghdadi and soleimani  the two worst terrorists in the world for many  many years  many decades  we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home  we're bringing them back home from all these far away places  we spend hundreds of billions of dollars  and what do we get out of it  biden voted for the iraq war  he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military  he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden  he opposed the killing of soleimani  he oversaw the rise of isis  and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-baghdadi  the founder of isis  couldn't find him  they looked  they couldn't find him  i found him and we hit him good  we hit him good  and you saw the mueller family on television  you saw that at the convention  what al-baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter  and incredible how our troops handled that  you should see it  it was incredible  biden also cheered the rise of china as a positive development  positive development for america and for the world  how are we doing with china  we just have the plague  we've had other plagues sent by them  i wonder if they did it on purpose  what do you think  i got to tell you  i was sailing to an easy election  this was going to be so easy  i probably would have not been here tonight  i would have said  ""no  we don't have to bother  this is going to be窶ｦ"" and now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is  i can't believe it  when i banned travel from china  biden called it hysterical and xenophobic  do you remember that  i banned it  everybody told me  ""no  no  no  you don't have to do that "" but i said  ""we have to because wuhan is very infected and they're coming here "" so i banned it  later on it was said to be a great move  if we had listened to joe  hundreds of thousands more americans would have died  if biden wins  china will own america  and it won't take long  with his son  hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever  no investment窶ｦhe didn't even have a job  joe biden is weak and will always cave to china who is strong  when the virus arrived  we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii  we're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers  the case fatality rates  we have the lowest of any major country in the world  people don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it  under operation warp speed  we're producing a vaccine in record time  this is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon  very  very soon  by the end of the year  but much sooner than that  perhaps  and this is something that's incredible  this would have taken two or three years by the last administration  and in all fairness  by most other administrations  we have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible  and totally safe  joe biden and kamala harris  rated the most liberal  are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric  that's what they're talking about  so now they know we have it  it's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time  so instead of saying  ""that's a great thing  we're going to save lives "" they're trying to disparage it  they're trying to make it politics  they're trying to do so  and now what's going to happen is we'll have it  and people won't want to take it  that's really bad  okay  that's really bad  but the biden-harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out  getting it out  and we're going to get it out fast  the vaccine will be safe  these are the greatest companies in the world to do this  the greatest labs  the greatest doctors  it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year  and maybe as i said  much sooner than that  joe biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide  drugs  alcohol abuse  heart disease  and much more  and that's what you're in right now  you're in a shutdown  it's crazy  i've been to many states  they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better  they're doing better  somebody's got to speak to this man  dan  maybe you got to talk to him  dan  go in a little early and say  ""you don't know what the hell you're doing  you don't know what you're doing  they're hurting our people "" north carolina has to open up  by contrast  my administration is following the science  protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school  go back to school  go back to school  you ever see the statistics on young people  i don't know  they have a great immune system  let's get some of that immune system  but they're amazing  i mean  thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected  very little meaning a small percentage of 1%  it's an incredible thing  nobody knew that when it first came here  nobody assumed a thing like that was possible  but young people are very strong against this horrible disease  through our historic china virus relief programs  we've saved more than 1 3 million jobs for north carolina workers  that worked out great  we provided  380 million in relief for north carolina farmers and made  10 million in ppp loans to save- 窶ｦ and made  10 million in ppp loans to save your state's tobacco growers  we saved your tobacco growers  we have them very much in our sites  we want to help them  the biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger  biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations  we got rid of more regulations  he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%  you couldn't build a road  we took roads from 18  19  and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one  you may get rejected for a highway or for a road  but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months  you're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand  i know all about it from the real estate business  we brought it all the way down  he wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers  establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records  you wouldn't believe  i mean  this stuff is not even really believable  but it is what it is  he wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country  flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants  including many from jihadist regions of the world  biden opposes school choice  he opposes north carolina opportunity scholarships  and he has stated that if he is elected  charter schools are gone  he said  they're gone  and they've been incredible  in the second term i'll provide school choice to every parent in america  and we'll also take good care of our teachers  our teachers are very  very important to me  very important  nothing more important  a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities  great jobs  and a limitless future for all americans  and just in finishing  i have to say that over the next four years  we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world  and we will end our reliance on china once and for all  we'll make our medical supplies right here in the united states  we will enact fair trade deals that create american jobs and grow american wages  we are going to bring our companies back home where they should be  i've been doing a lot of it  but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible  we will rapidly return to full employment  soaring wages  and record prosperity  we will hire more police  increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement  surge  federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities  we will protect government benefits for american citizens  not for illegal aliens  what you're doing when you have all of these advantages  when you're giving them free healthcare  and free lawyers  and free college  and free everything  they all come  they didn't think of coming  but they see this  they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in  they want to come to america  you're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that  we want people to come to our country  but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally  very simple  we will appoint prosecutors  judges  and justices who believe in enforcing the law  not their own political agenda  we will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race  color  religion  and creed  we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life  we will uphold religious liberty  free speech  and the right to keep and bear arms  we will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless ridiculous foreign wars  we'll build up our military like it's never been built up before  we need our military for other reasons  we will have the strongest we have now  when i took over  our military was depleted  we have a lot of military people here  our military was depleted  our planes were 50 years old  now you have brand new  beautiful f35s  we have brand new rockets and missiles  and hopefully we never have to use them  i will say that  but the best way of not having to use them is to have them  if you have them窶ｦ we learned that in the school yards  right  we learned that in the school yards  the best way is to have them  we have the strongest military we've ever had by far  we'll end surprise medical billing require  price transparency  which i've already signed into law  which by the way  kicks in on january 1st  you better elect me north carolina  i did price transparency and i've cut the price  drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations  so we did price transparency  kicks in january 1st  could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down  hospitalization  doctors  you can choose your own doctor unlike with obama  right  price is going way down  january 1st  i said  couldn't you start it sooner  but statutorily that's when it had it start  could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock  and they'll say  what a great president he is  he would have never done it  and your drug prices  prescription drug  i'm instituting favorite nations laws  so we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest  and you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world  we'll protect medicare and social security  and we will protect your social security  and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions  always  america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars  very exciting  and i will reopen nasa  that place was gone  they had grass growing out of the runways  you had to see it  now it's the number one space center in the world by far  you see what's going on  we will restore patriotic education to our schools  oh  you know what i'm talking about  look at you  this is a very sophisticated group  tom  you know what i'm talking about  patriotic education  well  the first thing they do is they want to take your history away  that's a great group behind me  i don't know  they're activists  but you know what  you know what it means  they want to take away your history  that's why the monuments and the statutes  they want to knock them down  the first thing they do is take away your guts  it's guts  they take away your guts  they take away your statues  they take away your heroes  they take away your great generals  they take away your past  and i said  it was going to happen  i said  ""you know what  they started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of "" and i thought that was bad  and then they went up a little bit and now i said  ""someday it's going to be robert lee  someday it's going to be washington  someday it's going to be lincoln  someday it's going to be jefferson  someday it's going to be benjamin franklin  it's all of them  they take away your past  they never taken away our past  that's the way they do it  you study it  that's the way they go  they take away your guts  we'll teach our children to love our country  honor our history  and always respect our great american flag  and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto  in god we trust  this is better than the arenas  i have to say  especially when you have a crowd like this  but they're like this  they have such spirit in this country  people love our country so much  i went to texas  i went to ohio  i went to florida  it's always like this  they love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody  we're not disappointed  for years you had a president who apologized for america窶ｦ so you had a president who apologized for america  now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of north carolina  this is the most important election in the history of our country  i wouldn't say that lightly  and frankly  i thought the last one was  and i said it  but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible  these people have gotten stone cold  crazy  and you know what  after we get in  we're going to have tremendous success  and it was building  we were at a point  we were so successful before the plague came in from china  we were so successful that we were starting to get together  people forget  we were starting窶ｦ success brings people together  it was so good  our jobs numbers were so good  and whether it was the black community  the hispanic community  the asian community  our jobs were so good  our numbers were so good  we were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop  we had to close it up  we had to open it and start all over again  if you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market  some of the stock markets have already broken every record  you look at nasdaq  you look at some窶ｦ we're far ahead of what i had planned  we're far ahead of schedule  but we did it once  we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event  a terrible event  a horrible event  so many people died  nobody should have died  not one person  so many people died  but if we didn't do it right  we would have lost millions of people  just a terrible thing  but oftentimes i say  bring people together  and then i realized  if you look at that last few months  we were starting to come together  i was getting calls from  you won't believe it  democrats  i was getting calls from democrats and they were saying  ""wow  things are going really well "" it was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again  there'll be great unity  eventually there'll be great unity  so get your friends  and get your family  get your neighbors  and your coworkers and vote  and i say this because it's from charlotte to kitty hawk  from durham to asheville  and from wilmington to right here in winston-salem  we inherit the legacy of north carolina patriots who gave their blood  sweat  and tears for this beloved nation  we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans  blaze the trails

34,18,Aug,2020,datasets/Yuma,"oh  thank you very much  everybody  thank you  well  thank you very much  thank you very much  and considering that we caught president obama and sleepy joe biden  spying on our campaign  treason  will probably be entitled to another four more years after that  i wanted to thank you  and art and brandon  you're incredible  i've known you now a long time  right from the beginning  we had the chemistry  we had that good chemistry窶ｦ oh  sit down  it's 122 degrees in this place  and we have our great governor  governor  can we make it a little bit  just a little  this is like a test  you think joe biden could do this  i don't think so  so i'm thrilled to be in yuma  arizona to proudly accept the endorsement of the national border patrol council  that's a big deal  and they are great friends of mine  and we're building the wall  next week  we'll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall  and our numbers are the best  we are very tough at the border  when people want to come in  for our farmers  et cetera  et cetera  we're not going to hurt our farmers  but we've never had better numbers than we have right now  and that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now  we have never been helped like this  wall  there are two things  in a thousand years you can come back  two things will never  with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box  but two things never get old wheels and walls  wheels and wall  if you come back in a thousand years  you'll say  ""well  we still have wheels in walls "" and that's the only thing you'll recognize  the national border patrol council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the united states border patrol  they've been my friends from the beginning  to every border agent  and i just met some unbelievable people backstage  these are great people  and every family member here today  you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation  and i want to thank you very much  thank you very much  as you know  better than anyone  the survival of our nation is at stake in this election  and i will tell you  i never thought i'd say it because we had a great election  we had a great election a little while ago  four years ago  i never thought i'd say anything could compete with 2016  this election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country  because we had crooked hillary  but this is something  these people are sick  and we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond  because this is beyond socialism  that it doesn't happen  or we will indeed have venezuela on steroids  so we can't do it  most important election  november 3rd  get out and vote  joe biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of america's borders and boundaries  they want to take the wall down  they don't want to have borders  they want to have sanctuary cities  lots of bad things they want  following orders from his boss  i guess his new boss is bernie sanders  can you believe that  crazy bernie  joe biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement  suspend all removals  provide free government healthcare  and they want to give it to illegal aliens  you don't get it  restore  catching and release  shield violent criminal aliens  this is what they want to do  and give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim  and gain automatic admission into our country  we will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before  you get free education  you get free healthcare  why wouldn't they come  let's go to america  the biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen  it's crazy  biden's plan is the most radical  extreme  reckless  dangerous  and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate  it must be defeated  and it will be defeated on november 3rd  it will be defeated  at last night's democrat convention  which by the way  got very bad ratings  i have to tell you  unity  they talk about unity  they want to bring unity  and then you listen to michelle obama's speech  which was obsolete by the time it got there  she taped it  no  she taped the speech  it was obsolete  she must have taped it about three weeks before  i'm speaking next thursday  maybe i'll tape it  but i don't think that goes  that's so much nicer  to tape it  you do it  nice air conditioned room  and she not only taped it  but tell me when you hear a divisive speech窶ｦ they talk about me as being a divider  i'm not a divider  i bring people together  we were bringing people together  we were bringing people together  like never before  success was bringing everyone together  and then we got hit with the china virus  but we were bringing people together  but one of the opening speakers last night said that america will go to hell if we don't have open borders  think of that  go to hell  when a country doesn't have borders  you don't have a country  today  a democrat speaker at the convention said  ""we're talking about abolishing the police  we're talking about abolishing ice  we're talking about abolishing prisons "" biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others zealots  by the way  they want to double and triple your taxes  they want to increase regulations  they want to spend very little money on our vets  after we took care of our vets better than anyone's  91% approval rate  and they want to spend much less on our military  we've totally rebuilt  two and a half trillion dollars  we've totally rebuilt our military  bernie sanders declared  in his speech  many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical  are now mainstream  that's bernie sanders  because joe  he doesn't know where he is  but if he did  he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know  it will have problems  it will go down  your stocks will be gone  your 401ks will disappear  and right now  who has the 401k  and then the rest of you  many of you have stocks  and you do it a different way  that will go down 50  60  70%  80%  and if you held on  like i said to do  we went down a little while we got hit with a virus  now  nasdaq just broke an all time record  snp  just broke an all time record  socialism is the mainstream of the biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of america  remember i said  we will never have a socialist country  on november 3rd  the people of arizona  our great state  we love arizona  i won it last time  by a lot  and i hear we're going to win it by even more this time  don't forget  last time i talked  i said we're going to give you a tax cuts  i gave you  i said  we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts  give you your tax cuts  i gave them to you  i said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts  we're going to give you great everything  we even did right to try medicine  you know all about that  we did things that i didn't even talk about it  we did  we did a thing called the space force  you never heard me talking about  i'm the only candidate that gave you more than i promised in the campaign  it's true  i'm the only one ever  maybe ever  or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the white house  we're joined today by some incredible people  friends of mine  great  great people  and i want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast  i don't know  are you sure you even had a spike  doug ducey  a great governor  great man  and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points  that's not so bad  and i think you're more popular today  what a job you've done  thank you very much  doug  a friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot  and i had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the warthog  right  the warthog  she said  ""i love that plane "" but she was a great  great fighter pilot  one of the best they were telling me  this was a group and they knew a very well  a lot of friends you have  and specifically she said  ""could you extend that plane  that's the best plane  it never breaks down  it just is a winner "" but martha mcsally is an extraordinary person  and she's fighting for us  and she's helping us  and we have to bring her into the center  thank you  martha  and she's running against a gentlemen who is  when you read what he's done  when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things  you're not going to want to vote for  you're not going to want to have them play with your second amendment  i'll tell you what  if i weren't president  i don't believe  doug  you'd have a second amendment right now  i don't think you'd have  the pressure that was put on to get rid of it  or to basically obliterate it  make it so it's meaningless  you will always have the right to bear arms  you will always have that  a few friends of mine who are warriors  paul gosar  paul  where's paul  paul  stand up  will you  paul gosar  thank you  paul  appreciate  great job you're doing  these are warriors  they really are  when they went and they tried to make a play at your president  they had to get through the house  what were we  197 and nothing  that's never happened before  everybody came together  the republicans came  other than mitt romney  one half a vote  one half a brain  another friend of mine and incredible fighter  and somebody that loves his state  and i'll tell you  the freedom caucus  right  and we have a man named andy biggs here  he's a fighter  he's a fighter  and he loves our vets  and he loves our military  and you love our second amendment  right  and we're not going to do anything with it  they will destroy that second amendment  just remember i said it  but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen  a woman who really distinguished herself  she became a star  she became a star overnight  there was nobody tougher  there was nobody smarter  there was nobody better than debbie lesko  great job  debbie  thank you  we want her on our side  right fellas  we got to have her on our side  also  thanks to arizona republican party chairman  i knew this was going to happen  i knew that she was going  she never stops  she never gives up  kelly ward  kelly  thank you  thank you  kelly  great job you're doing  are we winning  okay  good  i think we are  that's what they say  we better win  if we don't win  this country is in big trouble  big trouble  also a great friend of all of ours  former state treasurer of arizona  jeff dewitt  thank you jeff  and a man who didn't choke under pressure  i don't even know if he's here  i think he might be here  he never choked  he kicked for 11 years  you know what that is  you ever see a golfer  they miss a three footer  they miss a three footer  they can't take it back  they choke  choke  choke  well  kickers are the same  right  nfl kickers  this guy lasted 11 years  he's one of the best kickers ever  nfl kicker  jay feely  where's jay  where is jay  he's here someplace  where is he  jay  what happened  you couldn't get a good seat  jay  i remember the 61 yarder  that was a heartbreaker  right  but the only thing is  i'll bet you this man would stand  only stand  for our national anthem  that's one thing  that's one thing i can tell you  and if they don't stand for our flag  if they don't stand for our national anthem  i turn off the game  other than that  i'd like to watch  but i turn off the game  and by the way  i thought they learned that lesson a little while ago  i thought they learned that lesson two years ago  but maybe not  but they will  they'll learn it again  this time it'll go even faster  for decades  washington politicians like biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate american jobs and wages  also  the crime was incredible what happened  they allowed criminal gangs to menace  maim and terrorize innocent citizens  they came in  they would maim and terrorize  and we have done something with our border patrol  and by the way  ice  ice is great  ice has taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13  and you don't want the job  there's some tough people here  none of you want the job  it's a tough job  but they like it  and they're great patriots  and they've done a fantastic job  they ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth  this is what would happen  they have ceded  and what we've done  did you ever notice the caravans  what happened  debbie  there are no more caravans  what happened  what happened to the caravans  they don't come up anymore  the caravans don't come up  you know  we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to honduras  guatemala  el salvador  hundreds of millions  and i said  ""well  why are we doing that "" and they wouldn't take  when we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries  they wouldn't take him  and they wouldn't take him under the obama administration  so we got stuck with them because they'd fly in  they'd say  ""don't land your plane "" and i said something very simple  i said  ""that's okay  we don't have to do that  we're not going to pay you anymore  we stopped payment "" we stopped payment  it's amazing how that works  doug  right  we stopped payment and they called  they said  ""we'd love to take them  we'd be honored to take them "" so we take them back by the thousands  by the thousands  they let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities  but no more  it's not happening anymore  the cruel and heartless portrayal of the american people ended the day i took the oath of office  and now that we have more than half of the wall built  and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore  they don't talk  why don't you talk  i went  ""look at all those people back there "" that's called fake news  fake news  look at them  it's the fake news  they don't talk about the wall anymore  see  we won  we got the wall  it's going to be up to 300 next week and it's going to be finished very soon  and as soon as we want  all of a sudden  they never talk about it  but you know where i talk about it  numbers  the numbers are so good  the numbers are so low  we've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built  you don't get through it  you can't get through it  you can climb mount everest  and you're going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker  i stood up to the lobbyists  everybody fought us  the democrats  everyone  i fought the special interests  i kept every single promise that i made  and now i'm doing it with the drug companies  i just created favorite nation  so if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay  the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price  and they're spending so much  they're spending millions of dollars on advertising  anytime you see an ad from a drug company  and they're rich  the farmer  it's called big farmer  the number one lobbyist  they spend millions and millions  hundreds of millions of dollars online  anytime you see  anytime at all  you see an ad by big farmer against me  you know your drug prices are coming down  that's what it is  they're not happy  and we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man  the rebate  it's going to the people now  we're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people  they are not happy  i have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much  but you are going to get 50  you are going to get  and the democrats would never do it  biden would never do it because he doesn't understand it  but they would never do it  they would in a million years  they wouldn't do it  it took a lot of guts to do it  i had a lot of people  a lot of good politicians go  ""sir  i don't think you should do it "" i wonder why you're saying that  but we did it  we're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time  by not 2%  and last year they went down a little bit  first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit  we're going to have prices dropping 50  60  and even 70%  drugs  about time  and i'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border  our border patrol  in the history of the united states of america  we now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better  and we want people to come in  but we want them to come in through merit  right  and we want people- 窶ｦ people to come in  but we want them to come in through merit  right  and we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country  not hate our country  here in yuma  arizona  we've invested over  1 7 billion and poured 180 000 cubic yards  that's a lot of concrete  to build 108 miles of powerful border wall  i know who's going to vote for me  i don't know though  i think i'm going to win yuma  what do you think  doug  i think  when i hear those numbers  when we hear those numbers  we're winning  we're going to win yuma big  now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure  all capable  all wired up for cameras  for everything you can have  technology is incredible  in total  i've already completely planned for the final execution  we're going to have  by the end of the year  everything that we said is going to be built  we may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years  so we actually may put up some additional  but we will have it completed  everything we said  by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible  and we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year  and if we keep going at the rate  it'll be about 85% in about two months  so it's a great honor  and you know what  your community is much safer  you see the difference  it's a much safer place to be  but more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release  you know what catch and release is  these great men and women catch somebody  maybe a murderer  maybe a rapist  maybe a trafficker  they catch somebody  take his name  take his number and they release them into our country  and they say  ""come back in four years  you have a trial "" no more  we take them out  we bring them out  and nobody said that was possible because i couldn't have gotten it through the democrats because they don't like that  so we have people coming in to this country  some great people  some really bad people too  and i mean murders and i mean rapist  i mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back  when we bring them back to their country  could be mexico also  they don't come back  under the obama biden  i call it obiden  under the obiden administration  our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands  and by the way  mark morgan  where's the great mark morgan  he's around here someplace  mark morgan has been so incredible  one of our executives  he said  ""we never built the cages  those cages were built in 2014 by obama "" we never the cages  they were built by obama and the fake news is constantly saying that i built cages for children  i didn't build them  they were built in 2014  there was a headline in time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it  they said  ""he didn't build it  we built that for the obama administration "" but they don't stop  they keep calling it  they say i built the cages  you'll hear it in one of the debates  they'll say  ""you built cages president "" i said  ""no  i didn't build cages  that was built by obama "" under the trump administration  if you cross our border illegally  you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home  we are proudly defending the job safety and security of the american people  which is what i promised to do  nobody told me it was going to be this hard  nobody told me i was going to have the democrats go totally crazy  this was like a life and death war  you know why they don't talk about it anymore  because they know it's bad politics  because they know having a wall  they can't win that one  so they just say  ""let's forget it ever happened ' because we won and they say  ""let's forget "" they don't want to talk about it  that includes the millions of incredible hispanic americans who follow our laws  uplift our community and protect our nation  in uniform  half of all border patrol agents are hispanic americans  i was just with them  and today i salute each and every one of those true american heroes and that's what they are  and nobody understands the border better than hispanics  they know what's good  what's bad  they don't want bad people coming into our country  taking their jobs  taking their homes  causing crime  hispanic americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it  they understand it better than anybody  with the help of these patriots  we've stopped the rampant asylum fraud  shut down the human smugglers and we're finding the drug dealers  traffickers  predators  and we're throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home  ms-13  for the first time that you've ever seen this  ms-13 is totally on the run  many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we're deporting its members in record numbers we've never reported  i can't believe how many there are  but if biden wins  it will be a giant jail break for ms-13 and vicious criminal gangs  china wants him to win so badly  iran wants him to win so badly  when we win  i'll have a deal with the red within a month  watch  because they're dying to make a deal  but that last hope that biden will win  they will own our country  china  they will own our country  we made such a great deal  last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country  the largest single order  then they did it again  you know why they're doing that  because they know i'm angry  because they know i don't care so much anymore  we made a great trade deal  but i don't care  but it shows you how smart they are  doug  another with normal brain power  they'd say  ""well  i'm not going to buy any more corn "" that's good  and we'll just decouple  thank you very much  but they go the opposite  they buy so much  good record numbers  soybeans record numbers  last week  biggest ever  42% of our farmers crop is now china  over the last little while  you know why  because they don't want bad things to happen  that's why  so they're very smart  when i have every farmer in the country calling and saying  ""please don't do anything "" they're very  very smart  but we can never forget what china did to this country and did to the world  the historic achievements that i've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years  here's just a short list of our landmarks  really they are landmarks  true landmarks  we instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions  including jihadist regions  keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country  everyone said  ""oh  that's so bad "" remember when they said  ""oh  that's so bad "" i don't think it's so bad at all  we won the travel ban  the fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court  we lost in the second court and we won in the supreme court  so they said we lost  can you believe it  they said we lost debbie  because we lost the first two  but we won in the supreme court  so they said  ""they lost "" i guess  technically they're right  we lost when it didn't matter  but we have it  we have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in  over the last three years  ice officers have made over 380 000 arrests of aliens with criminal records  including those charged or convicted of over 145 000 assaults  40 000 sex crimes and 5  800 murders  over the last three years  border patrol and ice have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl  heroin  meth  and other deadly narcotics  and you see it all the time  we stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities  they want to have a sanctuary city  not going to be like the old days  we canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ice officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the united states of america  we removed 20 000 gang members  including 4 500  ms-13  that's pretty good  who would ever think there's that many  i entered into three landmark agreements with honduras and el salvador and guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system  we cut down that payment that i was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes mexico  right now  mexico has 27 000 of their soldiers on our southern border  helping us to guard our southern border  and we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for  that's what we've done  i entered into a historic partnership with mexico  known as the migrant protection protocols  to safely return asylum seekers to mexico  while awaiting hearings in the united states  you know about that  we had to have them in the united states and we captured them  we had to keep him here  i said  ""no  no  we don't want them here  we want them outside "" we got sued all over the place that we won  so now they don't come into the united states  they can wait outside  for the first time ever  the united states is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal  we don't have to go through years and years of litigation  you need perry mason to try and win  we ended the obama biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving  illegal aliens  think of that one  we established the national vetting center  the most advanced visa screening system  anywhere in the world  we know so much about the people coming in  we know the good and we know the bad  we've suspended refugee  窶ｦ good and we know the bad  we've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions  because nothing is more important than keeping america safe  to me  that's number one  we've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays  you know all about that  they overstay for years  they say  ""maybe a night  maybe two nights "" well  five years later  you catch them  no  we ended it  we issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals  we have many countries beyond the four that i mentioned  the three plus one  many countries  they all take them back now  before  they weren't taking them back at all  the last administration simply released these criminals  we're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home  we don't want them  we issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism  you know what that is  right  anchor babies  you know that  right  anchor babies  have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life  congratulations  you're a citizen for 90 years  then you bring in your family  you bring in your family  right  no  no good  i implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient  they cannot accept welfare for at least five years  to protect our country and our agents during the pandemic  my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens  we brought them back  we have very few in our country now  we brought them back  can you believe it  to protect us workers  i suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs  american jobs  and we're finalizing the new h-1b regulations to permanently end the displacement of us workers  in january after the china virus  after the outbreak  after the outbreak  the china virus outbreak  it came from wuhan  right  i swiftly implemented a travel ban on china and i was criticized  biden  opposed the ban  he said  ""i oppose the ban "" he had no idea what the hell he was doing  why do you oppose it  joe  i don't know  they told me to say that  if we had listened to sleepy joe biden  hundreds of thousands of additional american lives would have been lost  we did a good thing  that was in january  i imposed it  very early  a month later  pelosi and all these people said  ""oh no  let people come in  we can't "" we imposed it because china was heavily infected  then i imposed it in europe also  heavily infected with italy and france and spain  compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that biden and bernie sanders want  the entire biden窶ｦ harris  how about her  is she a great one  is she  by the way  you talk about guns  she wants no 2nd amendment  she wants to raise your taxes to a level you'll be paying your government back for a long time  she is not the right pick  but she was my number one draft pick  they asked me that  why do you think  i said  ""i'm very happy "" they thought i was happy  they thought i was happy for him  no  i was happy for me  the biden-harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing america's borders  in the biden  bernie manifesto  joe biden  promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire us border  you believe that  we just got rid of it  free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities  this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible  and you would have murderers  killers  rapists in your midst  i don't think so  immediately suspend all removals  triggering a tidal wave of  really a flood  if you think  a flood all across our border  end prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud  they want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate  now  this is all simple and i really respect because so far i've only seen about four or five people go down  because it is hot in here  but i will tell you this窶ｦ it's 120  you know what i said before  think of yourself at a great spa  great sauna  where it's 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there  you have to pay a lot of money  getting off the border  getting off illegal protection  all of that  we are going to lower your taxes further  we gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of窶ｦ the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country  we decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we're doing more because that's going to spell growth and that's what happened  companies are moving in like nobody has seen before  so we're doing that  massive additional regulation cuts  we've cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country  whether it's four years  eight years  or in one case  more  i told you already  our military is the best it's ever been  it's got  2 5 trillion worth of new  beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything  hopefully  we never have to use it  our nuclear arsenal  and hopefully  hopefully we never have to even look at it  our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it's never ever been before  and we have to have it there  but we never want to use it  so we have done things not only on the border  the border is one element  and to me it's very important  something that they always say about a president  the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices  so by the end of our  of not my  our first term  we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges  and two supreme court justices  when it comes to 2nd amendment  when it comes to life  when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for  if you don't have the supreme court and if you don't have the courts in your side  you can forget it  the next president  i think  will pick two  three  or even four justices of the supreme court  they can be on the court for 40 to 50 years  you pick them young  they could be on there for 40 to 50 years  this is going to be the most consequential presidency  this is going to be the most important  and i never thought i'd say it because of what happened four years ago  this is going to be the most important election of your life  so i just want to窶ｦ thank you  i just want to say stay healthy  stay sharp  be careful  be very careful  go out and work like hell  we need every single vote that we can get because it's probably going to be close  i always assume it's going to be close  they have these suppression  the fakers back there  they have the suppression polls where they interview many more democrats than they do republicans  doug and i were talking about it and they take out registered voters  it's not registered  they say  ""most likely to vote voters "" that's what  most likely registered  they're dead  they're old  they're not going to go  they're not going to do anything  be careful with your ballots  but get out there  november 3rd is the biggest date  one of the biggest dates in your life  in many cases  frankly  it's the most important date of your life  one other thing we've done lot  we've gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from obama  like the paris accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing  we've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea  but you know what  if we don't win  they can put it back  and with the things that we did put in  which are many  many  many things  many things  our military  our vets  everything  with all of the things that we put in  it's like a tree  it takes a little while to grab on  you transplant it  it's got to grab on  if we have four more years  there's nothing that they can do  our country is sailing  our country is sailing  so yuma  thank you very much  arizona  thank you very much  thank you for all your support  we love you
